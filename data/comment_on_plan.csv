"The vaccine plan according to liberals is in that little red book that back in 1993 J Chrétien keep campaigning about, to this date so many liberals have added many many plans and promises in it, but no one seems to be able to find it, and now Trudeau leads the pack in there"
"Starting a pandemic with masks can only be worn by professionals, to being among the last in the world to getting a vaccine, this is one big govt fail. We should be manufacturing our own vaccines within Canada, and N95 masks as well, enough so we can send them to every senior. incompetent."
Don’t forget the Libs tossing out our PPE and then giving what was left to China. Fail
"they threw out emergency stock of N95s last year, without replacing them, ... genius move."
Conservatives want to take a vaccine that hasn't been approved? No wonder they were so eager to inject bleach
making stuff up
drivel but thanks anyway 
Trump is more like JT the any Canadian conservative
"Its all good. The vaccines are coming. Anyone who wants them will get them. Until then, we'll take the suggested precautions and even for awhile afterward. Relax."
"You're scheduled to receive your shots in September 2021. Until then, just relax."
"It will be an ongoing process, with hopefully the last few people (20-somethings) in fall 2021."
This is being 1st in line? Sept 21st?
Kool Aid too?
Exactly. Politics I guess...you know
"If you Conservatives want a vaccine now and won't wait for one that is approved by Health Canada then I can supply you with one approved by Dr. Pepper. Will that calm you down? BTW, last week you were all saying the virus is fake, that you wouldn't wear a mask nor accept a vaccine that almost certainly contains a tracking chip."
The NDP tend to believe in science. It's Conservatyives who think science reached it's peak in the study of astrology.
"weak response. Still sticking to the idea that if you are of a particular political affiliation you carry those believes to things like science. So, no conservative scientists out there?"
Trudeau and Dr Tam have been a step behind since day 1
that's being generous
WAY behind
Western separatists should be the last in line.
"The only purpose of this announcement was to give us a large photo of Trudeau at the top of the main news page, again. Trudeau says."
"Why doesn't O'Toole present HIS plan, any plan, on anything. Easy to point the finger and criticise from the sidelines"
he is not in power. How many times will you ask this?
And he never will be
"Sure, talk in absolutes, it is the liberal way."
Sick and tired of the tories with their blah blah blah. Use people who can think for ourselves know that it will be rolled out in January and over time more and more people will get it. The people in September will be all the nay sayers who will eventually see there is no issues and roll up their sleeves as they don’t want to get sick.
"Antivaxxers are a curious group, made up of 80% from the far-right and 20% from the far-far-left. The former group are the usual science deniers, and the latter are another type of science denier who think everything can be cured with essential oils and meditation."
"The Feds will drop the vaccines off on provincial doorsteps, then wash there hands of it. If distribution goes bad from there, they'll just point fingers. Just like health care."
Anti-maskers are a virus complete unto themselves.
I don't trust our PM anymore. So much spinning of half truths I don't know what to believe. Trudeau says
When Justin says he’s procured something he means he has added the item to his Christmas wish list for Santa to deliver.
Trudeau changes his mind more often that he changes his socks and we all know about his socks.
What WAS that drivel O'Toole evacuated yesterday about Canada putting all its vaccine eggs in China's basket. Doesn't that man read anything at all? The reformer/cons suffer from a lack of leadership .
How much did that fiasco cost us in the form of a donation to China?
"You should read. That was the only chance of Canadian produced vaccine, now Canada is entirely dependent on foreign producers"
"Imagine how much quicker we would have had the vaccine for Canadians... if:this government was competent, had taken advice and had an open door with the opposition, hadn’t been so focused on padding the pockets of friends and family, hadn’t been preoccupied with hiding from scandal after scandal, were more focused on results, actual plans and budgets instead of generating spin, narrative and attacking the opposition, hadn’t prorogued in the middle of a pandemic (with zero parliamentary agenda refocus), Just imagine! But rest assured, as he claims... Justin is “working for Canadians”. Incompetent, Trudeau says"
"You're aware there's no proof they'll actually work, right?"
"UK, Europe and most likely the USA will begin vaccinating soon. But here because of an incompetent govt we have to watch more people get sick and die. TAKE IT TO COURT, LET A JUDGE DECIDE HOW RIDICULOUS THAT ASSERTION IS."
"This is the time for all parties to cooperate - if there is such a time. But the Conservatives are being obstructionist and criticizing handouts to needy people and necessary programs, or actually, only complaining that the Liberals have to chock it up on the debit side instead of conjuring it up out of thin air, like the Conservatives apparently would."
"Canadians will now pay with their lives due to the silly virtue signaling and not picking a cabinet based on qualifications. Trudeau says, incompetent"
"Anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers, anti-distancing-ers etc. all fall into the same group of people who think every human being is an island unto themselves, and that society does not exist. This ignores the very essence of what makes us human. Actually, humans are not the only example of a social animal - far from it. It is the norm. Wear a mask when indoors - anywhere except your own household. Don't attend or host parties or attend gatherings. I would say small funerals are the only type of gathering that should be exempted, because they play an important role in closure.
Get vaccinated when your time comes."
Did we learn anything from this Trudeau press availability show? Are Canadians now feeling reassured? Trudeau says
So why does the PM not tell us how long the approvals take? Did they even think to ask?? Never mind thats a rhetorical question..
"So many additional Canadian deaths will result from Trudeau's vaccine delay. Where will it stop, we are at 12,500 today. Will Canada see 25,000 deaths? 40,000 deaths 50,000?"
"So blindly following sheep, when you're told you need multiple injections per year, will you have any objections?"
"Mr PM , question, Do you dye your own hair ? And if not who does ?Sorry that's three questions !"
"The vaccines are not safe"". Safety trials were wrapped up months ago without any untoward incidents. Nearly all incidents occur in the first couple of months, and the new mRNA technology eliminates the issues seen with old generation vaccines based on attenuated live viruses. ""The vaccines are not effective"". Independent data monitoring boards are reviewing the results and found that at least three vaccines are effective - Moderna's, Pfizer's and AstraZeneca. The first two 90% and the third one around 60-70%. ""The length of immunity is short!"". Actually, nobody knows the length of immunity. It may be short it may be long. Either way, it doesn't change the vaccine debate. It only changes the frequency of vaccination - which we will address in the upcoming years."
"polls showing that a sizeable number of Canadians will refuse a vaccine altogether, or will wait some time before lining up for a shot,Con's sphinx's are all taught over this news.RELAX, LOOSEN UP, STAY AWHILE."
Earlier today a Conservative on this message thread was lambasting Trudeau for not promising the vaccine would be effective on COVID-20 and COVID-21.I guess he thinks Trudeau is omnipitent.
"Lib are most distressed that the ""Go Fund Me""page for the clown in TO who opened in defiances of the lock down has been removed. The left sees him as a hero of the revolution."
Good luck to all non-thinking guinea pigs.
"No, just incompetent. Trudeau says"
The liberals are just throwing money at a problem without any experience to actually do something. Trudeau says
He's my least favourite person but he's doing the best he can right now. It would be nice if people would just give him and all politicians a break every now and then. They never signed up for this disaster too.
prorogued parliament is the best they can do
"I look forward to travel again. Tacos in Mexico, walnut tortes in Austria, tapas in Spain, food markets in Taiwan. I look forward to seeing family again. I look forward even to awkward work lunches. We don't realize how much we miss things until they are gone. Bring on the vaccines. Doesn't matter if we have to get vaccinated twice a year every year - it's less bothersome than a visit to the dentist."
Conservative opposition is now pushing for a parliamentary probe into the CanSino deal. I'll bet it got something to do with Meng's house arrest. But Cons gotta smear so they stir up that pot.
"I definitely trust the Trudeau Libs far more than I trust the O'Toole Cons who would do or say anything to benefit themselves even if it harms Canadians. Especially considering top Con MPs like Rempel and Poulivre playing with conspiracy theories, pumping out misinformation, and doing their best to politicize the pandemic response like when Rempel dismissed the evidence of a pandemic committee just because it's head, a scientist, had donated to the Libs in the past. Their job is to hold the govt to account not to dismiss evidence just because the messenger hasn't supported the Cons. That sort of politicization of the pandemic response kills people, it's why Covid is so out of control in the US.I was pleasantly surprised by the opposition parties early in the pandemic but am appalled by much of what I'm seeing, especially from the Cons but I've also been disappointed by the NDP who haven't seemed to understand the difference between federal and provincial responsibilities. The Trudeau Lib govt's pandemic response obviously hasn't been perfect, it's been the most unique situation all of Canada has been in since WW2 so I'm willing to cut them some slack, I don't expect to support everything any govt does. But I have no doubt the Trudeau Libs pandemic response has the best interests of all Canadians at heart. We've seen in Ontario and Alberta how con premiers have used it as cover to benefit their donors in some of the most blatant cases of cronyism I've ever seen in all my years paying attention to politics. Also it's no accident that the provinces worst hit by Covid are run by conservative govts. It makes me very grateful we have the Libs in office in Ottawa"
"Sorry Canada, put all our eggs in the Chinese vaccine basket that fell thru...oops I messed up again. Trudeau says"
Cottage is holding on tight to the message this evening.
"Is perdue pharma going to b find 5 billion in BC lik it has been in th UK and USA? Or are we going to find out that thy slithered into Canada for ""free distribution"" of drugs?"
"O'Toole also slammed the government for partnering with a CanSino, a Chinese-run pharmaceutical firm, early in the pandemic to jointly develop a vaccine. Sure, O'Toole knows everything. But doesn't mentions the billions in Canadian exports that ships to Jhina."
The people frothing at the mouth to be the first to be injected without qustioning products are wholly welcomed to be first and last in line for one.
"O'Toole again pushed the government to offer a firmer date for access to a vaccine. Trudeau said again they'd be available shortly after Health Canada signs off. NOTHING APPROVED, NO ONE CAN SHIP......O'Toole as daffy as last guy."
Which vaccine will Justin be taking? Which calibre? That would cure some of our financial malaise.
"I do not see any Cons supporters on this site any more, they were saying all kind of nasty things about Trump. Even CBC everyday news about US election for the last 8 weeks. Any news about Justin, Tam and Patty on CBC how they handling the Chinese virus so far for the last 11 months absolutely nothing."
"justin why not pony up some money to provinces so that they can deliver some health care for Canadians through the pandemic.of course you won't. you are worried you would just make premiers look good on ""your dime"". that's why you occupy an office you don't deserve. Just get out you weasel. Trudeau says"
Self proclaimed and reported efficacy beware with that there’s a motive here and it rhymes with cash.
"while he's announcing $100b additional spending, there is not an additional cent for provinces to spend on delivering health care through the pandemic. so all that spending is just virtue signaling on our dime. he's not interested in doing the right thing, or spending money where it is really necessary. the guy is the worst kind of snake oil sales man."
"As quickly as possible. with the king of fails in the cottage, Trudeaus says"
Is paying lib trosls part of JT economic recovery plan?
Trudeau's approval rating are higher than Jason kenney's in the Conservative Fatherland (aka Alberta)
The anti-vaxxer movement sure is picking up steam here. Good. We're overdue for some natural selection.
"The LPC is looking to charge the Deputy Minister of Finance who resigned today and gave 2 weeks notice with treason or crimes against the state or some such thing. Story on the capital suggest he no longer wanted to be associated with the LPC and their actions.They did ask him to remove the words ""transparent""and ""ethical"" as they are not in the LPC dictionary"
Then the as quickly as possible didn't help you? Trudeau says
Unless it's Trudeau's resignation I don't think so.
"So blindly following sheep, when you're told you need multiple injections per year, will you have any objections"
There are some exceptional examples in here of the LPC exploiting the youth of Canada to get their message out there. By Georg and the little one
"This is the time for all parties to cooperate - if there is such a time. But the Conservatives are being obstructionist and criticizing handouts to needy people and necessary programs, or actually, only complaining that the Liberals have to chock it up on the debit side instead of conjuring it up out of thin air, like the Conservatives apparently would."
who will be the first to take a quickly made vaccine ?
"OK, Trudeau has changed his story 3 times in the last three days about when we can expect vaccines in Canada. Better? Trudeau says"
"The Feds will drop the vaccines off on provincial doorsteps, then wash there hands of it. If distribution goes bad from there, they'll just point fingers. Just like health care."
All this free marketing for big pharma!!
Anti-maskers are a virus complete unto themselves.
"Trudeau already has a recovery plan, the liberals on here are in no hurry to get a vaccine that according to them isn’t approved by health Canada, or is approved, very hard to actually know what is what with them, but they are sure good at telling conservatives something that they don’t seem to see eye too eye with each other, including their leader"
"UK, Europe and most likely the USA will begin vaccinating soon. But here because of an incompetent govt we have to watch more people get sick and die. Trudeau says"
It couldn’t hurt to be a bit farther back in line. Let’s wait a bit and see what happens.
"vaccines will roll out 'as quickly as possible. That should be given.Anything else, Trudo to add? Trudeau says"
Sick and tired of the tories with their blah blah blah. Use people who can think for ourselves know that it will be rolled out in January and over time more and more people will get it. The people in September will be all the nay sayers who will eventually see there is no issues and roll up their sleeves as they don’t want to get sick.
"Why doesn't O'Toole present HIS plan, any plan, on anything. Easy to point the finger and criticise from the sidelines"
"Healthcare workers...including psws. Nursing homes, schools, Drs office if you are particularly at risk. To say it is easy"
"Vaccines work primarily by depressing the R0 value to less than 1, and the pandemic flames out because the virus runs out of ""fuel"". It is akin to dumping water on a forest fire. The fire flames out even if there is still dry tinder here and there - the key is to interrupt it and disrupt in several spots, not literally soak every square inch of wood. People who refuse to get the vaccine are not endangering only themselves but the rest of society as well. It's no different from the usual anti-mask behaviour."
"At the end of this poker game China won, we all lost, because our mist intelligent genius Jt. Tam and Patty"
Even though I am in a high risk group I will not be disappointed because I do not expect the jab until September or October. As for the healthy 20 year olds with a bit of luck maybe 2022 or 2023.
You won't get autism with this vaccine... rather IT WILL TURN YOU INTO A LIBERL
"If we shut all the flights and the borders for first there, then we all watching hockey now"
"Too bad the MSM prints snippets of O'Toole's yapping. I guess they have to do it for the sake of the elusive 'balance', but it's really, really annoying"
"Transparent govt? lol, oh so far from the truth. Trudeau says"
Transparency? I guess Libs never got the memo from the transparency obsessed Harper.
"The key is 'safe' and that means leaving the scientific decisions to the experts, not partisan operatives trying to score cheap points."
Of course they will be ‘safe’ but will they be ready for distribution. That’s the issue on the table atm.
"The world is way past science when it comes to the imbroglio of the vacine. Commerce, lobbying, politics, anti flavour of the month, standard methodology, science is observation, experimentation and/or calculations so none of the above."
"The vaccine plan according to liberals is in that little red book that back in 1993 J Chrétien keep campaigning about, to this date so many liberals have added many many plans and promises in it, but no one seems to be able to find it, and now Trudeau leads the pack in there"
they also closed down the pandemic warning system in 2019
16 tons of masks given to china. Justin love china.
Conservatives want to take a vaccine that hasn't been approved? No wonder they were so eager to inject bleach
"I remember Justin message in April ""GO HOME STAY HOME"". I saw on CBC 10 times. In the mean time 6.9 million foreigner's came to this country message for them. Go out have party and spread the virus."
"I really wish people would not comment on vaccines unless they hold an academic background related to vaccinology, epidemiology or medicine. or at the very least basic biology. Let the scientists do their jobs. You do yours, whether that is barista, car mechanic or insurance salesman."
you see how people think they can be experts when the part time drama teacher pretends to be PM
"Canadians will get their vaccinations ""as quickly as possible"" according to Trudeau. Well, that pretty much nails it. Trudeau says"
Hopefully this madness will be stopped somehow.
Its good to see were waiting for health Canada's approval. I have no trust for any American organization.
"I will get the vaccine - mRNA vaccines are safer than the old generation of vaccines. Furthermore, they have not been rushed, only the bureaucratic aspects were ""rushed"". They went through phase 1, 2 and 3 trials as any other vaccine. The vaccine was developed in February; it took until November to get results. Doesn't sound rushed to me."
"I'm not sure what the issue is. The vaccines have to be approved, then manufactured and then distributed to countries. Does ANY country have a plan?"
hard for provinces to make plans when they have no idea when they will receive it...shall we keep the freezers chilled til September?
The US plan is to start vaccinating their citizens next week and to be 100% complete by June.Canada has no vaccine and no supplier.
So you’re saying you can’t make plans until you have all the information? then their plan is fantasy.
"obviously, Nov 22, 2020 — US, Germany and UK could start Covid vaccinations as early as the 11th or the 12th of December,"
"Only one word come out of their mouth JT, Tam and Patty from Jan till March. ""THE RISK TO CANDADIANS VERY LOW"". The Chinese virus spread like wild fire the actually risk was very very high. Trudeau says"
"Hard to blame them, they didn’t suspect that the uneducated in Canada would make thing this bad."
Trudeau is to blame for not closing our airports and borders for months and months as virus poured into our communities. Trudeau is to blame. Trudeau says
the virus didn’t pour into the country like that. Ten or less vpcases came it and it spread from there.
for a limited time and in this case - an answer I don't want from Justin Trudeau. Trudeau says
"A doctor stated that it should take 10 years to formulate a safe vaccine, this rush job sounds suspect?"
Is Trudeau going soon? I thought that the libs were putting Chrystia in charge. Is that going to happen as quickly as possible as well? Trudeau says
No one trusts you anymore Trudeau says
The Libs are going to drop the hammer on working Canadians by having the CRA hassle them for a few hundred dollars on some forgotten T5. Meanwhile the professional takers are swimming in money.
Not sure what the rush is. Not one province has submitted their distribution plan yet.
It's absurd how a virus turns into the usual political argument.
"I will get you that information on WE and how much my family received, as quickly as possible. Everything with this clown is as quickly as possible. we will close the borders, as quickly as possible. we will balance the Budget, as quickly as possible. In other words ....he has absolutely no clue about anything he speaks to. Trudeau says"
And yet we are handling the pandemic better than most countries and Trudeau’s support has increased.Maybe the cons can try some more faux rage and call for more committees again.
"no we aren’t. We have 12000 dead. Who are you comparing us to? the rest of the world, we are handling better than most. We are #23 on the list of most deaths due to covid out of 196 countries. So no we are not doing very well at all. We are doing very poorly."
But the Libs have managed to spend a lot of money... maybe they should have given very citizen a $100 bill to use as a mask instead.
Zero liability for the manufacturer and no national vax injury compensation in Canada. Anybody concerned at all about those things?
We can thank our lucky star we didn't elect as PM a guy who would have followed Trump's lack of leadership on COVID.
So Canadians are sliding backwards in the vaccination line. This will be a quiet Christmas. Wonder if Trudeau will have a tree in the cottage? He can invite the GG over for eggnog. Trudeau says
"So, O'Toole now declares another SCANDAL... and hardly anyone is listening"
"To the Libs, procurement means they have added it to their wish list for Santa."
"Procurement for any political party is a slow, painful process it seems. Approving vaccines , etc. is probably in the same bracket."
Trudeau and the Lib squad are big on rhetoric and very short on specifics. Trudeau says
Did CF discuss this last night. Reading the comments in here you can see why the LPC sees it as an issue.
as quickly as possible. About as committal as the Prime Minister can get. Typical
"Another clever Liberal slight of hand supported by their media. The $400 work from home tax deduction - likely a non refundable tax credit - meaning you get $60. Instead of the thousands of dollars you used to be able to deduct. With the word ""work"" in the sentence, the Liberals wanted to shut down the tax deduction."
This is the open and transparency you get.  I say to Canadians: hang on. We can get through this winter together and relief is on the way as quickly as possible
Yes it is called opaque
"Me: Hey son, when are you going to shovel the snow? Son: I'll get it done as quickly as possible"
Conservatives are on fire again. Canada must be winning.
"Pzifer announces they have a vaccine... We are told 3 million Canadians will be vaccinated by end of March (6 million vaccines, 2 shots). Moderna announces they have a vaccine... Still only 3 million Canadians will be vaccinated by end of March. AstraZeneca announces they have a vaccine... Still only 3 million Canadians will be vaccinated by end of March. Talk of Johnson & Johnson nearly ready to announce they have a vaccine... Still only 3 million Canadians will be vaccinated by end of March. Yet we have deals with these companies? Shouldn't Canada be receiving some number much greater than 6 million vaccines by end of March? Each new vaccine that is available from a company that Canada has a deal with should increase the number of vaccines coming to Canada in the 1st quarter of 2021, to some number much greater than 6 million. Shouldn't it? (J&J is a single-dose vaccine) "
Procurement means nothing says Otoole...lucky we don't have conservative government..
Procurement for the Liberals means major delays due to their incompetence for Canadians.
"It’s amazing how many people are convinced this vaccine will be important to them and there is back and forth blaming of Liberals vs Conservatives as if either side knows anything about a medical disease. Here is a dose of reality: If you are under 60 and healthy, you are going to get through the Covid era with or without a vaccine."
My grandson says he can run a 5 min. mile. My wife says she can run it in 30 mins. but cannot guarantee a finish. Both claim they will do it as quickly as possible. The point being as quickly as possible has little meaning as it depends on your perspective.
"I wouldnt be expecting Canada to be fully vaccinated until next fall possibly even sometime in 2022. This isn't gonna get all done in a few months thats for sure. Not to mention we still don't even know how long the vaccinations will even work for yet, could be only a few months"
"I'm not an anti vaxer, but I will not take a vaccine that has been rushed. These vaccines are experimental messenger RNA (mRNA) and are being rushed out and touted as the ONLY solution. My body my choice."
We get that the military will help in the deployment of a vaccine. We get that the gov’t says millions of doses are secured (38 million people.) We don’t need you to keep repeating this PM Trudeau. We get it. We need information on how the approval process is going and when you expect this to happen. As quickly as possible is pretty open ended and not very promising.
"This will keep the left up at night. Detail from last nights spiel by CF. Building off a commitment of $350 million made in Budget 2016, the Government is dedicating an additional $606 million over five years to support the CRA’s efforts to crack down on tax evasion and combat aggressive tax avoidance."
"In Liberal/CBC Canada, it is not what you do, but what you say. No performance required. as quickly as possible"
Lots of complaining from the Party that is going to lose tons of seats next election.
"Don't question what they'll inject in your body, anyone. Just smile and roll up your sleeve."
Why in earth did the liberals not ask all the vaccine manufactures to keep us informed and part of the tests since day 1. People are Dying
Topo Gigo gone for the night?
The US will definitely keep the border closed with the Post National State until the end of 2021 now.
"No government can please everyone, at least here we don't need to wait for richer nations donated vaccines."
As quickly as possible now or what could have been under a more competent government? Incompetent
Liberal times are hard times.
In general I think Canadians are getting tired of uncertain answers. Like how soon is as quickly as possible. Obviously JT has no idea when and doesn’t want to provide an answer only to be potentially wrong later.
"Say first, figure out how to do it later. sort of mentality when it comes to most things. It’s just become more obvious during the pandemic."
Deflection as a Liberal exceeds at.
That deal was abandoned after the regime in Beijing blocked shipments of vaccine samples meant to be used in clinical trials in Canada. Well that's a shocker to everyone but the Libs. LOL
Then why the HELL did the current government enter into a vaccine development deal with China? Answer the question as to WHY the current government did that.
"Trudeau's no shining light , that's a given."
"So liberal loyalists put their faith in the declaration of a Moderna executive who has not received regulatory approval , has not vaccinated one Canadian and has not committed to a delivery schedule with timelines and quantities if approved. Liberal loyalists are a gullible bunch."
"In other news, Justin won the race, but he is still standing in the starter blocks."
Drama queens.
"Since Justin was sleeping at the switch. Maybe Canada can join the USA, to get the vaccine?"
In time we will all be forced to get vaccinated like the rest of the world. The world will make it a mandatory requirement for places of business to reopen whether it be bars and pubs to grocery stores.UK has already put the suggestion out there to the people.
"I'm not an anti vaxer, but I will not take a vaccine that has been rushed. These vaccines are experimental messenger RNA (mRNA) and are being rushed out and touted as the ONLY solution. My body my choice. And I don't care what cyber war fare is going to be launched to try and silence any criticism of how these vaccines are being created."
"The Spanish Fly, distant relative of DT or Bathy?"
Did Trudeau stack Health Canada with unqualified friends and family as well?
Trudeau and Tam are responsible for the death of many Canadians as a result of their ineptitude. The lack of a plan RE: the vaccine is further evidence of their ineptitude.
"The altered Universe of the leftist media. Trump - Vaccines being flown in right now. Trump - Vaccines being flown in right now. Media - Trump bad, Trudeau good. Rinse, repeat."
I want Canada to approve the vaccines for the Corona V. before I use it to protect myself and those around me. I understand RNA. What a great time to be alive.
"What an obvious thing to say. ""No, after getting the vaccine, we think we will take our sweet time rolling it out...."", says no one."
"Exactly, Canada is in the same boat as the rest of the world, except we are we have reason to believe we are among the first who will receive it."
"Wonder if the left has figured this out yet?? Nope, they think 2025 is a time in the 24 hour clock. The first is the size of the increase in the federal debt. The statement tabled by Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland projects the annual federal debt will almost double from $721 billion last year to $1.4 trillion in 2025. That means the debt increases $650 billion, the result of piling it on for four more years after this year’s $381-billion extravaganza."
Still preaching from the steps of the cottage I see.
"If there is more than a 3% chance of complications from the vaccine, you'd be better off getting the virus"
Plane loads of vaccine heading to the US. Canada dining on Lib/CBC subterfuge.
Vaccine distribution. as quickly as possible. this is a delicate dance. in other words...don’t hold me responsible. May be the press doesn’t know how to ask questions
"I am so glad I was taught to think critically and question things, especially insane things like this vax. Good luck to the rest of you."
"Libs again struggling to be relevant, factual and respect the T&C. Well actually its just the same thing from them every day."
"Just saw on PBS in the US that they have firmed up their distribution plan by month starting in Dec for Health care workers and ending in May for the general population in descending age groups. How difficult can it be for our government to be working on this task while concurrently ensuring the vaccines are safe? People who are anti-vaxers will not be logical or rational in any event. Nothing JT can say will change their minds so basically a waste of time and resources to allay their fears, since nothing will."
"Our government is working on the task. Didn't you read the article? When we get the vaccine, everything else will be ready for it. Moderna says we will be one of the first countries in the world to get the vaccine. What more do you want?"
moderna actually said we are NoT the last. Nice libby spin tho.
Moderna did NOT say that. They said we're 'near' the head of the line. Being 'near' is not being at the head of the line.
False promises. Mismanagement. Financial scandals. Divisive policies. I welcome the upcoming spring election........as do the experts. NDP & Green Party 2021!
again for the con potatoes here tonight
"Um, you do realize that 'near' the head of the line is NOT 'head of the line'?"
"do the damn research...let me get you started...It's called GOOGLE. Nope. Please stop saying you researched it. You didn't research anything and I doubt you’ve experienced how. Did you compile a literature review and write abstracts on each article? Did you collect a random sample of sources and perform independent probability statistics on the reported results? You found something in your algorithm manipulated feed, something that complied with your personal bias, applied your emotional filters and declare it’s proof. "
"No need to get angry there. Take the vaccine and move along. Really, its your body your choice. Leave the semantics and just be calm. I'm sorry...do facts scare you? Angry? Not a chance. To suggest that Google is doing research is hilarious."
"Moderna, open thread with the CBC on here. 7700 posts, few from the alt left. Either there were not told or are not allowed there"
For the distribution of the vaccine sure reassuring to learn our military is better qualified than burger bros.
i prefer FedEx thanks.
Who else but the military would you prefer to carry out this complex mission.
"FedEx, UPS, Amazon. Etc. Miltary adds one year minimum to rollout."
The Procurement Minister is doing a great job.
"Said no sane person, ever."
You mean Porkcurement?
Based on what? How many Canadians have been vaccinated?
According to the people who would know she has. It's public knowledge.
Because she's procured NOTHING? That's public knowledge.
Messenger RNA technology is NEW for humans. It is simply unbelievable that the majority simply can't wait for this injection and don't mind one bit that it's 'ready' in a few months. How brain dead people have become!
you need muting. It is OPTIoNAL. Dont take it. Please.
not a bit. Thats how testing is done. Voluntary too
"I am so glad I was taught to think critically and question things, especially insane things like this vax."
"It's actually not new for humans - it has been used with success in other applications (mainly oncology treatments). I appreciate your reservations, but in drastic cases like these, we sometimes have to have some ""faith"" in the limited trial results we have. While it's possible we could all mutate into zombies in two years, it's also highly highly unlikely. The alternative (just waiting to get COVID or hope it mutates itself out of existence) is not very appealing either"
So you did no research? How else do you explain your conclusion.
Most people have no or mild symptoms! It is not as scary as we're supposed t believe.
"Oh, I agree that your risk of dying from COVID is low (like less than 1% depending on your condition). But the risk of dying from this vaccine appears to be much, much smaller than that (i.e. no one has died from the 10's of thousands who have taken it), and it's 95% effective in preventing COVID infections. Long-term complications are possible with the vaccine, but I'd suggest they're far more probable with COVID. So the math tells me, get the shot."
"""95% effective in preventing COVID infections"" - wrong. The vax is only going to reduce symptoms, not prevent the virus."
Oh my God...I think you just open the box...A lot of mindless zombies on this site are about to descend...
" I don't think you know what ""infections"" are. When the virus enters the body and starts to multiply rapidly because it has either overwhelmed the body's defenses, that is an infection. With the vaccine, the virus starts to multiply but is quickly stopped by the already-primed body's defenses. The period of unchecked multiplication is so short that we can't even recognize that it happened - hence we say it has ""prevented infection""."
"Just boggles the mind, how many here have no clue...You know, I have no objection with you getting ""the shot""...just don't impose your irrationality on others."
WHAT!? did you just say?...why do I feel like I need a shower?
"Are you talking to me? If so, maybe you can tell me why you think I have ""no clue"" or where you think I'm ""imposing irrationality on others"" Or why you feel like you need a shower (unless that's personal)."
just my speculation but I think certain versions of this vaccine are going to make people infertile. They've been working to depopulate since the 50's and most countries have signed onto the UN population control agenda. I just can't think of a better way to depopulate that to make people infertile through a vaccine.
"It NORMALLY take 5 years to properly vet a vaccine..yet here you are advocating taking an experimental unproven medication(technically only people who are at risk take a vaccine for influenza)...But hey, you are free to do so."
"I agree that the approval process for medications in general (not just vaccines) have been shorter, and that long-term effects can be ill-understood prior to approval (e.g. Oxycodone, Proton-pump inhibitors, etc.). There's no doubt too that the rush for developing this vaccine is a cause for concern. However, given the positive data in trials to date, I'm comfortable that the benefits associated with it outweigh the risks (which I think are remote). If you think the risks outweigh the benefits, that's fine, but you're definitely weighting as yet unknown risks, since no serious adverse effects have been reported to date"
"Yes, well...The science isn't set, so...I would rather have questions that can't be answered..than answers that can't be questioned."
"The ethical principle at play is that you've ""done no harm"" - i.e. the placebo people live the same way they would if they hadn't even been in the trial, and the outcomes are no different than if they had been in the trial or not."
cons spreading the mis-info.. and Fear.. led by baby trump
" just can’t let go of Trump eh, obsessed"
justin leads the libs what are you talking about
get over yourself sweetie. You liberals all need to be lined up
Get your own inflatable Trump.
baby trump
I vote NDP
im not cons are for leaders and finace critics
Gobbledegook
"In case you missed it, here it is again. The drugmaker Moderna announced highly encouraging results on Monday, saying that complete data from a large study show its coronavirus vaccine to be 94.1 percent effective, a finding that confirms earlier estimates. The company said that it applied on Monday to the Food and Drug Administration to authorize the vaccine for emergency use, and that if approved, injections for Americans could begin as early as Dec. 21. Thats the US, they do not have approvals in Canada."
Liberal kiddie corps trying to be relevant after being locked out of the CF thread
"What are you talking about? Trump deserves a lot of the credit for these vaccines, and he's touted them for a long time."
As quickly as possible is not an answer.
It’s the official Liberal answer.
It just happens to be very open to interpretation.
island time is liberal time
The virus will balance itself.
Oh look at that the oTOOLe says we are at the back of the line.. Yet Moderna says were at the front. Who to believe.. baby trump or Moderna?
Moderna did NOT say we're at the front of the line.
"Oh look, another defender who was not allowed out by the LOC last ight.. Well lets do with the Leader of the Opposition. Why you cry. Well because, Moderna has no approvals thats why."
Did Pablo the LPC House Leader sign your papers?
yes they did.. we are at the front of the line read.. you potato
"Well, when someone who posts inaccurate facts resorts to name-calling, consider me convinced."
Why do you find it necessary to post utter nonsense under someone else's name?
"Well, since you asked...IF Moderna (like all other Pharmaceutical Companies get their immunity from prosecution."
Who voted for that guy?
"The same number that will vote to re-elect him next time. The best thing Canada has going is the assurance only 30% of Canadians are fool enough to support the antiquated idiocy of conservative ideology. Canada has always been a liberal society, remains a liberal society and will always be a liberal society."
Don't blame all of us from the maritimes.
"Dr. Igor Shepherd is trying to warn everyone about this vax, as are many other in science and medicine."
"Could you not find someone a little further down on the crackpot scale? Just google his name. ""He believes that this fake pandemic is the means by which a communist global government will be ushered into existence; one that cannot be voted out."""
"You have noticed that globalists are taking over the world, right?"
as quickly as possible. Well that's pretty open-ended. the independent scientists reviewing the clinical trial data. Are these the same independent scientists who took FOREVER to finally approve rapid testing? And only did so when I'm sure the Liberals internal polls were telling them that Canadians were getting sick and tired of waiting for rapid tests to be made available?
I'll never vote Liberal again!
"Kenney won't either, how about Harper, O'Toole or Scheer? lol"
You can join the inconsequential 30% fool enough to support the archaic irrelevance of conservatism.
rennet who won the popular vote bud. Remember who Canada truly wanted. Deny deny deny all you want but you are still outnumbered
Conservatism isn't irrelevant just because you decided it is.
Didn't the doorstep salesman period end years ago.... not a place known for reputable claims.
"failed internationally, prove to state multiple falsehoods, proven unethical acts, has newfound guilty of abuse of power while in office, he delays or stop the public investigations that would publicly confirm his innocence, this is Canada’s PM. Trudeau your incompetence is beyond measurements!"
"Poor Robby, you trust the cons and were duped!"
"Many Many thanks Mr. Toole telling the truth last night, You are true hero."
Hopefully the RCMP investigation to the WE and SNV lavalin matter will either clear the PM or sink him. Either matters to me as long as the conclusion is based on facts and the truth be exposed
As quickly as possible is pretty open ended.
If the vaccine works then anyone who takes it shouldn't care if others don't.
"No. Some of us do care about the costs due to others' idiocy, such as the societal cost and the cost to the health care system plus the few for whom the vaccine will not work."
5% ineffective. I get it I take you out not with Covid either
I'm sure the opposition critics and some premiers will go straight to the head of the queue once a vaccine is available
and some premiers couldn't even take care of their own province in the past 8 months. So no room to complain.
And the current PM hasn't taken of the country either.
"Let's not forget how the country was kept open until his wife and mother got back from their paid gig with a government funded charity and brought the virus back with them, and how he went from Ottawa to Quebec for Easter when we were not supposed to go to other provinces. He allowed asylum seekers to continue to crash our border and admitted more legitimate refugees by the thousands. Yep. He sure took care of us."
"No date, no vaccine... easy to see these cats were not leading when proroguing."
You dont want it anyways. Admit it.
"actually I do.. but after the vulnerable and healthcare workers get it. I used to work in infectious areas so the current precautions and such are no problem for me. I actually wore a mask when traveling to/from Hawaii on Jan 17th due to this virus, saw this coming on Jan 2nd."
Getting this vax is the last thing I would ever do. I enjoy life.
Stay in your basement away from the rest of us.
And we believe this guy with his endless promises
"What promises in dealing with COVID has he not kept? He listened to the need to expand the CEWS, they continue to listen to groups about the stimulus plans that keep evolving, the gov't has largely been there for folks hurting....what is your issue, specifically?"
"And to clarify, I didn't vote for the guy, but I honestly don't get the vitriol sent his way non stop"
as quickly as possible is a generic catch phrase people use when they don't have an answer to the question being asked. It has no meaning.
Like Trudeau's majority of Canadians. Is that a 30% liberal majority? You know 30 % of the voters or just about 20 % of our population.
It must really bug you to know he'd win again if we had an election tomorrow.
how do you answer and unanswerable question? When will we be getting the first vaccines from a product that has yet to be proven to work and approved by the regulatory agencies?
"I don't like our PM , but he is doing his best to get the vaccine . I believe in early February or March we will be getting lots of vaccine .It will be a game changer for hospital and nursing homes ."
you “ believe”. Sweet.
"Gobble, gobble."
I believe is right up there with as quickly as possible and health Canada’s approval.
"Coronavirus vaccine should go to health care workers, long term care facilities first, CDC panel recommends. Trudeau will follow."
of course - why wouldn't he? I see grocery workers and other required workers are also further up the line
The scariest part of all is that he never seems concerned about any crisis while our Premiers are appearing stressed to the max.
"Why is it scary that he is appearing calm and collected, while also reiterating the emergency it is and the gravity of the situation?"
pretty sure he’s never experienced an uncomfortable moment his entire life
what's to be afraid of? You turn and face the danger and remain calm
Justin and his cabinet of incompetent flunkies are going to blunder this roll out just watch.
No more and possibly less than your favoured government would.
" level of actual education and competence is orders of magnitude higher in the LPC than the knuckldraggers in the CPC my friend - lol Kenney is a Jesuit high School dropout, Andy couldn't pass a broker's exam, half the CPC members never finished high school"
Canada has a commitment from Moderna to be included in their initial production. The US supply is being made in the US. Our order is being produced in Switzerland. The only reason this became an issue is because O'Toole and the conservatives tried to use it to gain political advantage. But there was never really a problem.
"ahahahah thats why the liberals have been in full damage control for days now. premiers demanding a plan and date from the feds but yes you're right, those dang conservatives!"
Wasn't that what Bryan was saying. OToole's fake news.
"I lost many brain cells just trying to understand your point. The liberals have no plan, no vaccine, no date to receive one, and not even what place in line canada is in."
Do you really know that little about how our it works? Canada has an excellent healthcare system. They do millions of vaccines every year.
canada has an excellent healthcare system? are you insane?
Why did CBC run a story about Russian vaccines all of a sudden?
I am typing from my psych ward. My Four Seasons.
"There's contracts and good relations. Objective studies do not have final buzzers, they have statistics."
More cons who don't know what the truth is or how to find it. Canada's Public Health Dept. has been doing millions of vaccine doses a year for decades. It's a matter of public record.
"If it was a woke flag waving event, our ever so lovely PM would be at the very front of the line, posturing and preening in front of the media as always. When it is something important, as always, this utterly vacuous fool fails miserably."
Not even a clue.
Ontario has Hillier and Canada has Dany Fortin. Why one Canada and one for Ontario?
there should be one more. Army does everything in triplicate lol.
Depopulation. Plain and simple.
Then it appears to be very ineffective. The death rate is low and it does not appear to negatively impact fertility.
"Along with the recent ruling in Portugal, there is going to be a growing amount of evidence for lawyers in Canada and elsewhere to pushback against lockdowns etc via the Covid PCR testing systems we have in place."
"Trudeau says vaccines will roll out as quickly as possible after Health Canada approvals. Gawd....we do not want an undefined abstract like as quickly as possible but rather a defined timeline. 4 hrs, 48 hours, a week a month.please define as quickly as possible Mr. Trudeau."
That is in the hands of Health Canada once it becomes available.
sooner than slowly but not fast.
Read my comment again.
What part of after Health Canada approvals do you not understand?
"As quickly as possible, means just that. He isn't going to commit to XYZ dates, because then it would be ""OMG, he is demanding Health Canada approve this by XYZ Dates"
"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau today sought to reassure the country that his government will be ready to deploy shots as quickly as possible after they receive the necessary Health Canada approvals. What that means...Once Big Pharma get their ""immunity agreement"", then the vaccine will be available."
"Look on the bright side. We are not living in the USA and they have more cases than all nations combined,"
"And that means Canada, we’re back?"
We are not New Zealand either where there are virtually none.
Canada believes she’s non-exceptional just so she could be exceptional.
I prefer to be compared to the cream of the crop rather than the bottom of the barrel.
"People here a miserable and cynical bunch. Sure its all Trudeau's fault, as per usual. Cry me a river. We are getting a vaccine a lot sooner then anyone predicted. We should be thankful for that instead of politicizing a pandemic."
yea libs don’t politicize anything lol.
LPC defender suggesting he does not generate false narratives... Made the coffee come out my nose..
as quickly as possible confirms he has no idea.
If he said December 21st and it tuns out to be December 22nd Im sure you would have a massive stroke over that.
Just in time for we don't need it. Trudeau and the gang are following the globalist script.
The misinformation from O'Toole the fool is stunning. And the neckbeards believe everything he says.
good at name calling.
Learning form JT cult members
Of course they believe anything he says. They patently don't do any research on anything they believe. The closest they get to research is reading personal blogs from other similar weirdos.
I read and learn from similar Trudeaus
"What are you trying to say exactly? Think about it, push the buttons. Take you're time so its legible."
Weirdos ... Trudeaus ... get it?
And the Trudeau minions eat up all his fairy tales.
But it's okay when right wingers name call Trudeau and his supporters. Okay then.
you your is grammatically incorrect
what did otoole say - specifically ?
they are the masters of empty insults.
They are simply empty
hard to disagree. They lower the level of discourse for sure.
The cons are definitely low brow and gullible.
I can think faster than you can walk.
Why not just say who knows when?
This will be rolled out when WE and Maggie are lined up to benefit from it.
Expect labourday next year. Thats what Trudeau calls as quickly as possible.
"This is not your traditional vaccine, it does not contain the virus (dead or alive). It's using a gene based platform that has never been used before in any approved vaccine for humans. Rolling out a new type of vaccine on such a large scale with no long term studies seems irrational and should definitely not be mandatory in any way."
"DNA and RNA-based vaccines: principles, progress and prospects - Author manuscript; available in PMC 2007 Sep 19."
"there's already lots of talk about it being mandatory for work and school. Will nurses be required to take it? They won't make it mandatory until they see how many people will volunteer for their experiment. Make no mistake, that's exactly what it is, an experiment."
Don’t get the vaccine if you choose wilful ignorance. There may be consequences (possible barring from public places). That’s up to you.
barring people from public spaces means it's mandatory.
"Hey, you're perfectly free to take it...no one is denying you right to do so...Yet...you seem to think your fear factor trumps my common sense."
"That is exactly what they are hoping for...They know to ""mandate"" it...is to insight opposition and push-back."
TOTAL failure PM.
"Pure coincidence no doubt. Likely nothig to do with CF and her spiel yesterday. Paul Rochon, the deputy minister of Finance Canada, is leaving after six years in charge of the key federal department. Dec 14th, last day."
following Morneau. Escaping before she goes under.
perhaps a person of integrity. Few of those in this govt.
Canada distributes millions of vaccine every year. We have an excellent healthcare system. Despite con efforts to try to tear it down.
lol. Thanks to the provinces we do. The wreckers are Trudeau's troops.
"While the vaccines may be effective in the short term, I have high doubts as to their durability. How often will we be asked to get boosters? Annually or bi-annually?"
"Agree, without the self-congratulatory rhetoric, this could have been handled in a paragraph. A star is born...ha, ha"
"Are those numbers the vaccine that they've ordered or ordered and procured? The pm was saying the other day that we're at the end of the line, but Moderna saying not so, what's the real story? Bigger question, who's paying for this and how much will it cost anyone?"
"taxpayers overall pay. borrowed money, Free to individuals. They will not give the honest story. Liberals after all "
"as quickly as possible, Trudeau seems to say a whole lot of nothing."
Vote Conservative Next Time. they speak and the speak transparently
it would make more sense to do so
the Libs do it moistly
Trudeau is shifting out Billions to friends and some voting groups; it takes time. If we are vaccinated NOW there is no need for the billions
I have a brain that doesn't generate false narratives
Trudeau could use one of those as well
"You ever post any for yours? Any view on this from the G&M. Paul Rochon, the deputy minister of Finance Canada, is leaving after six years in charge of the key federal department. Last day Dec 14... Any idea why?"
"Oh yeah. Tell us about your military service? Elevator ride in Calgary and no one wearing masks, Remember those."
As long as the vaccine doesn't come from China or Russia I'll consider it
I don't know about you guys but my worst fear is the Canadian government brainwashing and poisoning us by giving us rushed COVID-19 vaccines.
"the brainwashing is in the narratives spewed by this vapid Government... in lieu of actual pandemic or vaccine solutions, tangible budget, any accountability and legible recovery plan"
 It's called a general lack of trust of everyone!
"Covid has a 99.8 % survival rate without a vaccine, the promised untested vaccine has been promised to deliver 90% effectiveness in a virus that 99.8% of people survive? Welcome to the Twilight zone."
I’ll wait a couple of years at a minimum before taking it
feds are not that clever lol
Why take it at all?
A 99.5% survival rate means a 0.5% mortality rate. Hmmm... Something seems to be wrong with your figures. Across Canada we have had a 3.6% mortality rate since Covid hit. My figures come from CTV. Where are you getting your information?
"I'll support your choice, if you agree that should you get the disease after refusing vaccination you'll pay for your own Covid care."
I asked a question. I did not voice a choice.
"as quickly as possible, Like most things with the government you have take what they say with a grain of salt and use your best judgement. Remember...the government is not your friend."
"1% (370k) of Canadians have contracted Covid-19 .. SO FAR! Of that number, 3.25% (12k) have died .. SO FAR! Canada has done a VERY GOOD JOB at controlling this pandemic compared most industrialized nations in the. Seems to me that some very good decisions are being made. Also seems to me that a small minority of Canadians are not very appreciative of that fact."
"Given the number of people who are wishing for an early release of the COVID vaccine and are set on getting their dose ASAP, I wonder how many of them are against GMOs in food? After all, one is genetically modifying what we eat, with a large amount of conclusive studies showing no negative impact. The other is a novel mRNA vector for a vaccine, never before used in humans, that has NOT yet completed Phase III clinical safety trials and WON'T until late 2023, that directly genetically directs your cells to create a protein spike for antibody production.And if ONE anti-GMO person comes out in favour of an as yet experimental mRNA vaccine, their lack of knowledge and intelligence, as well as their ignorance-based hypocrisy will be laid bare for all to witness. "
Do you honestly think that an already over-reaching gov't won't take some sort of action to FORCE people? Like withholding your drivers' license or passport? Your tax rebate? Your ability to work or go to a store? Those measures would last about a week and a half before the citizens took over. And then watch whatever is left of hospital ERs!
tony I meant the govt generally. Interesting question about work? I don’t think as a general rule you can be forced but would have to consult a lawyer if one felt strongly.
joe i guess justin could try but that would be chaos. Possible i suppose. Lots would say no out of principle 
as quickly as possible. Can we have a date Trudeau? You did promise from your podium December this year. Did you forget what you said?
"Guess you didn't bother reading the story, vaccines rolled out as quickly as possible and the vaccines will be procured in the first three months of the New Year and vaccinations will start in March and we have the freezers and syringes already in place"
He will just throw money around and hope people will forget.
As quickly as possible when they are still negotiating delivery. What is the date? Provide the date.
The UCP in Alberta cut healthcare jobs by the thousands in the face of extraordinary rising Covid 19 Cases. Imagine the cuts these inn breads would attempt without a pandemic.
"more BS, money is given to the health services they spend it. If they want to pay all the top dogs over $600k and not lower services, that's up to them"
"Greasing the Party wheels, buying votes it all takes time.No rush on the vaccine."
"Same old ,same old from O'Toole and his reformer/cons. Strange he never says a word about that Conservative province out west . Why doesn't O'Toole ask Kenney if he has a plan"
Unfortunately Mr Nice Hair is PM
What does Angry Erin not understand about rolled out as quickly as possible and the vaccines will be procured in the first three months of the New Year and vaccinations will start in March and we have the freezers and syringes already in place? I think he has a hearing impairment of some kind.
When will the liberal god come up with a plan
Kenny would Crush JT in any battle
And Trudeau dragging his heels on a plan and just throwing money around has resolved this problem how?
As quickly as possible. Thanks
Labourday 2021. Good for you?
Otoole administered the Russian Vaccine to his family before catching Covid. He still believes a tweak here and a tweak there will make the low cost structure viable for high risk Canadians. The possible savings are worth the risk.
trudeau gave his family the liberal vaccine. They all dropped their IQ points. Not they could drop much though
drivel like that is unhelpful. Keep tryinh
"What a bunch of whiners. They should read this, scroll to the figure at the end"
Very good. It is what we have been told. The whiners should complain that we are too near the front off the bus.
"Firstly, Canada need not take ages to approve the vaccine. If it is good for America and Europe our guys are not going to reject it. As such, without wasting time, just go ahead and approve it. We are a nation of followers. We do not make statements by rejecting things that others accept. Secondly, what is as quickly as possible? Doesn't the government have a plan? Why can't the PM give some numbers and a time plan? E.g.: We will approve/disapprove within 1 week from receiving the data. We will vaccinate XXX people within the first week. We will expand that to 1 Million within X weeks. That is what people with plans say. JT has got nothing planned."
"They have a plan. All they need to do is add the dates to it. The problem is that we have no firm dates for when OUR vaccine will be manufactured. We also don't know whether OUR vaccines will make their way to Canada, or be confiscated by the country in which they are made for their own use"
Justin needs more time to shift the billions out
Health Canada has temporarily shut down due to covid concerns
I guess empty air planes are coming back from china again.
as quickly as possible. So how much of our money is Trudeau using to bribe Health Canada to drag their feet on approval to buy him time? It's a honest question of a dishonest government.
This government never denied that Covid was a major concern. The government south of us proclaimed it was a hoax and did nothing.
The government announced the $44 million project in May as part of a partnership between the NRC and a Chinese company to develop a made-in-Canada vaccine. I guess we wasted our tax dollars again.
"In other news, the finance canada deputy minister resigns, undoubtedly because he knows what the liberals plan is going to do to canada, and wants no part in it."
"as quickly as possible, Any word on how soon Canadians will get Trudeau's vaccines - after his UN buddies are finished?"
Russian vaccine story about how good it is. CNN got criticized about not being true. CBC takes a lot of reports directly from them.
"roll out as quickly as possible after Health Canada approvals. who says they're going to approve anything? Oops, I forgot about the gun to their heads."
We have no expertise here to develop any vaccines. How do you expect them to critically analyze any potential vaccine? Health Canada right now looks like a group of baboons trying to work a TV remote. They'll get there - but it's all for show.
"Canada's Deputy Minister of Finance, Paul Rochon, announced his resignation today. Questions will be asked."
when the liberals elect a drama teacher to be the PM.anything goes.
Otooles Russian Vaccine would be used on the unionized Health Care workers first..
A Conservative Approach.You first.
as quickly as possible. A straight answer would be nice.
instead of no clear answer.
"The only answer they can give is that it will get here when it gets here, and we'll distribute it as quickly as possible when it does. The arrival date is completely out of our control."
Otoole would be touting the Russian Vaccine and getting it at a 75% discount
That would save a lot of money if it works!
Probably better than the China deal Trudeau did where they took our money and said they will deliver nothing.
"They shipped nothing, and as a result were paid nothing."
you like to stir the pot and cause chaos like the other liberals
Mack is a paid Liberal poster. BS is his business.
CBC paving over another pothole in the Trudeau highway of failure.
I wonder what percentage of seniors will be vaccinated by the time they've vaccinated all the politicians? I'm a senior and am sure the politicos will get the vaccines before I do.
"In my circle of investors, we just finished divesting a combined 1.25million in various Canadian stocks/investments...and shifting solely to U.S. We're now officially ""Canada Free"". Most of us are just buying U.S. greenbacks straight up."
you need to prove that - or else its no different then saying you and your team ate cotton candy instead of working
50 Cent Trudeudollar coming. CBC will cheer and find a corner case story that makes it look like a success. While the main economy is ground to dust.
I was thinking of using my greenbacks as toilet paper because the drugstore ran out of it.
"Good for you. Your circle of investors should know that the Canadian economy was better than the US before the pandemic, and is still performing better than the US today with more jobs recovered than the US, per capita. If you're smart you should also divest your oil stocks before the coming tsunami."
"We ran the numbers ad nauseum. The U.S. economy is already recovering and Canada is ham-stringed by a delayed vaccine rollout. U.S. dollar will naturally kick into high demand, while the Canuck dollar will crater. If you're smart you should also divest your oil stocks before the coming tsunami."""
I think they will do their best. I refuse to believe that the health and well-being of Canadians are not the most important things to this government.
"the most important thing to this PM is to be re-elected with a majority so he can stifle any and all investigations into his, to say it mildly, miss behavings"
"Oh Sue, that would be lovely if that's how it worked"
"They are doing a good job compared to most other countries. The Cons on the other hand are swaying in the wind desperately hoping for some traction before the next election. O'Toole, Poillievre and Rempel have their winning strategy on display, that is to provide as much mis information as possible, never mind the facts. Good luck with that. The only consistent thing about the Cons is that they never learn."
We are taking on debt so Canadians don't have to.Say what.Who other than UStax payers have to pay this back. This massive debt is on our kids and grand kids back... Talk about smoke and mirrors.
"as quickly as possible, So Mr Trudeau said nothing and it's a new story? Come on CBC."
I found plenty in the article that was of interest. Mostly it wasn't about what Trudeau said. Perhaps your bias is leaking?
There was nothing in this story that has not been said many times before. There was no news here. Perhaps you have been living under a rock.
as quickly as possible. Spent the most money and we will get vaccines right after Angola.
I want the Saskabush vaccine just for better rythym in the next banjo bowl
"Would you, as an educated person, be willing to experiment with a variety of vaccine that is being rushed to market, by any number of companies, knowing that it often takes years for a successful drug to make it approved by Health Canada and the FDA in the U.S.A.? Not me, I'll wait for the trials to be properly done!"
And you will wait outside ..sorry
"This is a totally different process, you should read up about it. Damn right, I will be one of the first eligible to receive it and am going to get it."
"It was able to be done so quickly because of the massive amount of government money poured into the effort, and because scientists have been studying nearly identical coronaviruses since SARS in 2003. It doesn't mean safety has been compromised."
"I would - and will - do so in a heart beat. I have absolutely no fears regarding risk versus benefit. I am also educated in Health Sciences; I am stunned by the rampant anti-intellectualism and evidence-averse public, that think their weeks of consuming rubbish facebook contant somehow gives them credentials to question the most intensively studied health crisis in human history."
"I am the restaurant industry, the movie theatres, the mom and pop as well as box stores. The emergency room, the school and the workplace to make a few."
"The AstraZeneca is the only vaccine I would look at - it is developed by Oxford U, and uses proven tech. Won't be first in line, as I am not at risk, but I'd queue up after a few months. And Canada has ZERO orders.I will not take the RNA prototypes - they've been in development for 15 years read about them in The Economist - and never panned out."
Get the people at Tim’s trained. Do it at the drive thru.....everyone done in a day.
What a worthless creature can you call him human? Rules us
as quickly as possible. You will not see the vaccine until all the money has been shifted. Greasing the party wheels and vote buying.
The military has been charged with distribution good because this gang botches most stuff and the Liberals are going to keep throwing money at the problem until the taps get turned off. That's where Canada stands today.
"Always a critic, and yet Canada is punching well above its weight in all aspects of pandemic response"
"The distribution will be a snap for the military... just drop off shipments to 13 provinces and territories. The provinces/territories will do the rest with existing vaccination systems, just like before."
where and what? by buying every possible product? by not knowing when it will be available? and lastly by saying they can't do the job and farm it out at the last minute?
Vaccine will go to liberals first .
Justin don’t be silly
What about the 400K newcomers coming from hot spots in 2021?
"as quickly as possible. Canada first to ignore it African Safari, and viruses don't carry passports days, last to end it. Reset the liberals."
viruses do carry passports. You really need something worthwhile to whine about
as quickly as possible. Germany is setting up large scale vaccination centers while our federal government is still trying to figure out where to plug in the freezers we don't have yet.
"Pfizer vaccine can be kept for 30 days with the dry ice packs they ship the vaccine in. If it is still around after 2 weeks, somebody is doing something wrong"
as quickly as possible. Do any of the people in charge have an education in anything relevant to their job?
Salaries should be set accordingly.
like a math teacher getting a masters in basket weaving.
"Stay inside, mask-up if you go out, stay apart and crush this virus in 3 weeks, way before anyone gets a vaccine. But then you wouldn't have anything to whine about."
Only the rich can say that.
no the government payed people to stay home but covidiots would listen
You need the vaccine first to roll it out. Canada has none. Just another big head fake to keep the Canadians sheep at bay.
it’ll be longer than anyone thinks
"as quickly as possible. Canada, ask yourself this question: why is this man still the Prime Minister of our country?"
"If I cannot afford to pay for a baby why should I pay pre & post natal care, childcare, child credit, safe injection site, schooling cost, university cost of those who can’t afford their babies and will end up on my support anyways? don’t need your pension or healthcare Let me have my money i can grow it myself"
Still wondering why we don’t have a doctor as minister of health during a pandemic
He is PM because he is the best choice to protect Canadians from suffering the pain and shame of a Conservative government.
the welfare crowd loves him
He is the best Hippocrates who can sit on his estate fund mostly taxpayer money in his Florida state and lecture eloquently about socialism
"We'll have them demanding...no...begging for a shot of our product before year-en. What did the prime minister say to the pharmaceutical executive. I'll take ""Truth is Stranger Than Dystopic Fiction"
"When The bed is wet, You Know it was Justin Who slept in it"
as quickly as possible. So tired of needing a fire under his s for him to come out with some half truth. I’ll see it when I believe it.
The sooner the vaccine rolls out the sooner we can have a federal election
"Liberals are well ahead in the polls, and then there's Jagmeet for the prop up. Canada is in deep doodoo - unless you want to own nothing what about our pets?, have no privacy, and be told you have to be happy."
One thing about a chronic lie are is they just keep lying on one after another.
the other thing is they have to remember everything they made up. Notice a trend in Liberal Ministers on different pages?
believing his own untruths become incredibly problematic!
Approximately how many shares of Pfizer does Trudeau have?
"Not only he as an insider, on our dime, have advance calls on investments."
All the debate about the competence of the current government aside. the sooner we can get widespread vaccinations. the sooner we we can get back to some semblance of normalcy and I will consider that a win.
"They remain in office at the discretion of the voters. If the voters don't like what they saw before 2023, they are gone. Could be an election sooner than later given the minority government, but it is still us the voters. Or are you one of those Trump supporters who believe voters don't matter?"
"Take a look at conservative party history. They can't come to a consensus within the party. How do you expect them to rule the country, when they can't govern themselves?"
"I'll bet that Trudeau wishes he was PM in his father's time where there was no internet, and nobody doing fact checking on what he says and doesn't say. He is painting himself further and further into the corner. The UK is expected to approve the Pfizer vaccine this week and is already taking appointments for vaccination. The US will approve the Pfizer vaccine on December 10th, and the Moderna one on December 17th, with vaccination starting 48 hours after approval. What will Justin say when Canadians see the Brits and Americans getting vaccinated, and all they get from Justin is a lump of coal in their sock. We have a vast array of vaccines in our portfolio. This portfolio is the biggest portfolio that the world has ever seen. The number of vaccines is incredible. We have the highest per capita number of vaccines in the history of the world. Nobody has ever seen anything like this before. Yes, Justin but when? ""Ummmm, Ahhhhh, Have you seen my drink water box bottle thingy? as quickly as possible."
He doesn't now nor has he ever given a tinker's damn for the working class.
"If you want to see how his ideology was born, look to Pearson and to PET who was Pearson right hand, who later became PM. This was the beginning of the Liberal’s undermining of Canada."
Well I think it would be fair if the roll out started on the West coast and moved eastward as supplies allow
"Trudeaus bananna non budget released yesterday, top man in finance quits today with 2 weeks notice. Trudeau fails again. as quickly as possible"
"Lets see, we have known about this pandemic since February. We did a deal with the PRC in May -they reneged! We then went ,cap in hand to other suppliers with an open cheque book and no delivery dates. The upshot is that even with a president of the USA unwilling to even to acknowledge the Cov19 virus, all Americans wanting the jab will get it by the end of June 2021. In Canada our PM suggests that maybe by September -didn't say which year 1/2 of Canadians might be vaccinated. We have been had so badly! as quickly as possible"
Hadju tells us there are delivery dates in every contract. But she won’t tell us what they are. None of our business apparently
"Anand said today that there are ""delivery windows"". And ""we have a whole portfolio of windows, more windows than anybody else in the world. Nobody has ever seen this many windows of delivery times before"
"Could not possibly be firm dates, given that nobody knows for sure the exact date they would each be approved."
"Trudeau is buying plenty of vaccine to ship extras overseas. You will pay for it Canada. It is part of his scheming, the reason there is no anchor to how much he is will to spend your tax dollars and borrow your great grandchildren’s grandchildren into debt."
"Actually, I heard on NPR Radio that some countries, possibly including Canada will donate tens of millions of vaccine doses to underprivileged countries in Africa and Asia"
Why would he do that? Does the UN gfactor into your answer or is he planning to move to Narnia or Middle Earth and wants to ingratiate himself?
That's a good thing. In a global community we need to stop the spread everywhere or the virus will simply keep returning.
Nobody is safe unless everybody is safe. Remember that?
"So in last weeks picture on ""botched"" he was clean shaven and all that. Today he looks like he usually looks. Cottage managing all parts of the LPC message for the media..kt has been busy."
We haven't even gotten into the distribution logistics issues yet. Those will add another 3-6 month delay
The provinces all have distribution systems that have worked for the flu for the last 10 years or so. Average of about 30% of Canadians got flu shots with a peak in 2009 at 41% for H1N1.
because the gov't has never distributed a vaccine before. They have nationwide systems in place and the additional logistics are being addressed at multiple levels. The fact that you don't know anything about this is because you're not involved in it. The fact that you assume that nothing is going on is because you don't know anything about this.
as quickly as possible. How can anybody still think he is doing a good job?
denial is the new trend
i think they left . now nobody does
And yet the polls show he is widening his lead over the Conservatives. In fact in Alberta Trudeau has a higher approval rating than Jason Kenney.
if thats true. thats funny as hell
What polls are you referring to?
"polls are insanely accurate, thanks for the update"
Complacent and indifferent Canadians think he's doing a great job.
Yet another repeat from yesterday.
"He doesn't know. Like everything with this liberal government, they don't want Canadians to know. Transparency isn't their forte."
The Trudeau Government will set this up so that if it goes smoothly they will steal all the credit and if it goes bad it’s all the Province’s fault and not there’s. That’s all they care about.
"Typical of the Liberals. We have a plan but we can't tell you. Why because we have no idea of what we are doing. I was a drama teacher and a social lite, how did you expect we to be a leader of a country. As quickly as possible."
Every day Trudeau's story changes. Will we ever get the truth from our ethically challenged Prime Minister?
I love it. We'll be ready when health Canada approves it. Already setting it up to pass the buck
Really? Does any Liberal still have faith in this guy? as quickly as possible
"I have just a wee bit of faith left in him, which is far more than I have in the other party's leadership."
"I can't believe just how resoundingly incompetent Justin Trudeau and the Liberals have been. They've completely mishandled the pandemic from the get go. But let me guess, this is all of Steven Harper's fault? Complete and utter incompetence. as quickly as possible"
Trudeau did not listen to the Military in Jan when they advised there was a virus in China. Why is he going to listen now
"I admire Mr. Toole. I am going to start raising donations for conservative party of Canada. I watch his entire speech last night it was shocking. I have thousands of customers, I can assure you I can raise millions for conservative party of Canada. I am also going to donate $10000 asap. No news media across country told the Truth for the last 11 minths except Mr. Toole last night."
Trudeau says. Trudeau says nothing of value is the missing words. as quickly as possible
"as quickly as possible. Health Canada has provided its approval, we are well-placed to begin deliveries to Canadians as quickly as possible. We will kick into the delivery process as quickly as possible. That's why we have the refrigerators procured. That's why we have the needles, syringes and gauze procured,"" she said. What delivery process? Asking for a friend. the provinces."
Conservatives still adding contaminated liquid to their cornflakes for breakfast
"This isn't about cons or libs... it's about people wanting to get back to work, school and family. Let's try not to make it political."
Libs still adding contaminated liquid to their cornflakes for breakfast....??
Just graduated from the LPC defence school. Must have been at the bottom of the class.
 it's about making guidelines for covid more important than demanding unanswerable questions. we get the vaccine when available. covid is now
"the best defense is to stay home, wear masks if you must go out, and keep 6 feet apart....can you promote those guidelines.."
Take your vaccine and shove it shill.
"I'm on the left, oh wise one."
Mask taking oxygen from whatever brain cells left?
This website just loves putting our Prime Ministers mug front and centre daily. He is an embarrassment and nothing but a phoney actor. As quickly as possible
Almost makes you think he has a flair for the dramatic
but he was born to do this! Haha
I say something like that about a Conservative and I get red-shifted.
"A phoney actor with a constant smirk -To him, everything is funny - even this pandemic it seems"
"He's smirking since he's finally being recognized by the globalist cabal, that is after selling off Canadians' rights and sovereignty. Future generations are on the hook for billion$...oh no that's not right...the IMF will forgive all debt as long as we agree to all their evil commands. We'll own nothing and be happy, apparently."
"JT is a perfect example of how appearance is effected by actions and behavior. This supposedly good looking individual, is currently as ugly as the ugliest of his appointees, in and out"
Georges is a full fledged globalist puppet. Tyranny looks good on you.
"as quickly as possible. Letting a bunch of pointless third world countries get the vaccine ahead of us is not only a great way to lose an election, but become a social pariah too."
Bill has been experimenting in India and Africa for years.
Trudeau intends to provide vaccines to those countries on tax payer’s dollar.
"They don't want him yet Gates and ""that techology doesn't exist"" thing on his lap, are insisting to be ""chartible"" in their eugenicist utopia."
I'm not naive enough to hope the side effects of the vaccine include x-ray vision or invisibility; I'd settle for a second scrotum on the end of my chin.
What? You want to be a BallChinnian of MIB 2 fame?
"Mike devries asks, "" which mutation does this ""vaccine"" covers? or does tapwater has a better effect?"" only to be one-upped by Ori Omessi who fears that it ""depends your purpose. Covid eradication, or fighting population growth"", Andrew Petriw goes further by informing us that ""instead of getting a covid vaccine this federal government is trying to implement SOCIALISM that many don't want."" It is unclear who is performing all of this nefarious work as Gary Turnbull has informed us that ""Trudeau can't even show up to work""."
"All nonsense.. except that last part has a grain of truth.. how long did he avoid parliament, only to prorogue it?"
"Those are your teammmates, not mine."
Every team has its embarrassments.. you know its true.
I do and for legitimate conservative voices it is a tragedy that your team has the most. You folks should seriously push them out to the People's Party where they belong. You're getting tarred with the same brush.
"Its hard to ignore, lets call them ""over the top"" opinions from all sides. As to number, there may be more or less on any given day.. but I hear you, they tend to make us all look bad."
"The Canadian government wanted to believe a vaccine from China was going to be the cure at the beginning of this pandemic. After that deal fell apart because it was a deal with China, we got the Moderna deal. Canada's spot in the Moderna queue is because of the governments timing to sign the contract and nothing else."
The Vaccine will still most likely come from China after the Moderna deal falls apart
Do we have any idea how long the immunity from the vaccines could last? It's kind of disconcerting that this isn't even being discussed in the media. An article published in the Lancet this September warned that immunity could last less than a year. So this could end up like a yearly flu shot except that everyone should be getting it.
3 Months Minimum Line up Every 3 months for a re up
"Yeah, that's what I fear. At the same time, if enough people get vaccinated in a short period of time, we could reach heard immunity for long enough for the virus to kind of disappear as it cannot find new hosts."
This isn't going away with one poke in the arm
of course. It will be until the virus mutates. Necessarily less then a recovery from infection
that is key info from all our past experiences ... we just need the majority vaccinated and quick like
How could anyone know for sure? That takes time to tell. I have seen estimates that it will likely be at least a year based on tracking of mutations and other factors.
"A vaccine for a virus that is cannot be detected from a test not meant to test viruses, is not a vaccine worth taking. That and the fact that Gates, Schwab et al are openly telling the world their nefarious plans."
Will the vaccine be effective against Covid 21 and 22 ?
watch the trailer for songbird and find out.
"Why not demand a vaccine from Trudeau that cures all diseases, even the ones we don't know about. That is essentially what you're wailing about"
as quickly as possible. Why bother. He cant deal with the present let alone the future..
Do you expect he should deliver on a vaccine for diseases that are as of yet unknown?
"As the romans did 2000 years ago, keep the population happy by providing bread and circus"
"The left/right paradigm still works well, with the aded layer of who is a conspiracy theorist and who blindly obeys the government/media. I'd rather be considered the former any day of the week."
"Did you get The Vaccine yet? No? Well, I got mine. Nyah nyah. Side effectasd? Nonb theot I'm aware ov. Blerble bleop. thhhbbbt."
"I think Mr. Toole told the truth last night, it was shocking."
"Cade, Jerome, Patricia, LPC pom pom wavers noticeably absent from the CF thread but back here now in living colour. Of course the message from the left is not managed. Just like the PM and his family did not benefit from WE."
Trudeau on the cost of fighting the pandemic.. ah um.. I don’t know.
"When JT can't answer the question, he always refers back to his pandemic plan, that it's the best and pats himself on the back."
"instead of getting a covid vaccine this federal government is trying to implement SOCIALISM that many don't want, Wrong guy for the job"
"The money they are throwing around our money BTW should be put into turning out vaccines so people can get back to work, school and family."
That's what they're doing. Did you even bother reading the headline? 20 million doses requires some cash.
"did you even bother reading that millions are being thrown out for child care, loans, businesses...?? If this group had been organized the money would have purchased vaccines already, not stand in line behind the US and UK. This has been mishandled from the get-go ... we have no room to criticize our neighbors to the south."
"did you hear we may not get a vaccine until Q3 2021, when the USA is getting it now, reading is a skill, and this covernment is like smoke and mirrors to implement socialism while we are locked up"
Why is our national broadcasting corporation blocking my references and links that show we will get the vaccine in late 2021 and possibly 2022
JT also said late September.
"by the way: which mutation does this ""vaccine"" covers? or does tapwater has a better effect?"
"depends your purpose. Covid eradication, or fighting population growth"
All the weakest link defenders the LPC did not want on the CF thread have been released here Tell me again the LPC does not have a media message management control team.
"All the cool kids are talkin bout The Vaccine, 4 out of 5 Experts recommend rolling up your sleeve for The New Vaccine. Be the first kid on your block. Limited supply. Batteries not included"
I see the Cons losing big seats in an election. All hat and no cattle for them
"You are not write again.. Were you not allowed on the CF thread from yesterday? Good move on the LPC part, you make the left look bad every time you try and defend them.. As you did here"
20-40 seats. Looks like a wipe out.
Given where your head appears to be you cant see anything except dark walls that smell funny.
An awful lot of faith is being given to an unproven vaccine. What if giving this to our frontline workers goes wrong?
"Two have been proven in the US, just not authorized yet. One proven in the UK, and expected to be approved this month. What do you think all the 3 phase testing was for?"
it is way too early in the process to say its safe. It normally takes 10+ years for vaccines to be deemed safe
I hope you're right. Usually these vaccines go through years of trials. This one hasn't. You can't blame people for being a bit leary of it. I know I am. But I do hope the vaccine is safe for those who want it/need it.
So far the only elected Conservative hoping for a federal failure is Mr O'Toole.
after certain health canada officials get their share of the donation and motivational subsidies
"You should actually look what JT says now. That is history, not news."
Build back better or build back the way the Cons want? I see an election coming.
That's the Problem now isn't it . The Libs left things in a way that need to be built back better. shame on them
Note how all of a sudden there is a plethora of posting tossing our vacuous one-liners. Shift change
"Details are scanty from the Liberals, lol, as usual."
The Conservative Party should add Wile E. Coyote to its logo give they are as effective as he is.
"And the Libs should have Alfred E Neuman as its logo.....fyi, both parties have their issues, not just the Cons"
"Natural immunity is far more effective. Before rolling out a vaccine, place a test to detect the naturally immune."
"You mean...do precisely what we have done every year in history prior to 2020....? That's so crazy, it might just work."
I know right... I'm not sure people can handle all that liberty
"It has never been done in history. I have had vaccinations for small pox, polio, TB, Yellow fever, tetanus, bacterial pneumonia, shingles, and at least 15 varieties of flu and have never been tested to see if I had them first."
Trudeau can't even show up to work
You can have mine. Double up you will be safer.
The vaccine only works on humans.
Here is the article where he says Sept. Now its as quickly as possible. So there really is note date is there PM?
Trudeau failed Canadians yet again
"We need more transparency in the charitable sector – but unfortunately, a certain group is pushing hard at reducing transparency and they are being quite successful. Bur the CRA has just removed any requirement for a Canadian charity to report on non-partisan political activities, what are now called PPDDAs."
The only thing left for Conservatives in Canada is to be part of a Borat skit.
"The level of failure of this government, makes the majority of leftists want a conservative government - which is an unprecedented level."
Justin made a brilliant cameo in the new borat movie btw
These false flag vaccines will never be rolled out ...maybe only for rich fat cats like the Trumpster !
Justin you spend $44 million tax payers money with Chinese company for research. Don't you know how many peoples sleep on the sidewalk across the country
It was the NRC.
Give it up. The Liberals did a good job on this and Canadians are happy with them. The number of outstanding scandals being promoted by the far right that remain active: 0. What will they invent for tomorrow.
your correct..... if you live in bizzarro world
i think most the scandals come from the liberals and the far left ... Just saying
 you are in the minority and soon to be gone
i cant pay my family directly with tax payers money but i can donate to a charity that does
"Patience, we will have access by late 2021"
Trudeau will have legalized and distributed Recreation Cannabis Faster the Feds will approve and distribute the Vaccine. Its all about Priority's
Collecting the most taxes is the priority ! ...LoL
Unfortunately I can’t post a hand created Canadian wreath! 2 drinkin boxes and 3 bananas...hand crafted gifts are the best!
"Contractors bidding for the job of distributing the vaccine have been told by Ottawa the work could go into the end of the second quarter in 2022, or June 2022"
That seems reasonable. Sixteen billion doses are required word wide.
So you are happy to let this play out that long here in Canada?
"No, but we can't change what is. That being that we cannot make it ourselves, and we are on the list with only 37 million out of 7800 million waiting for it."
"as quickly as possible. Staying in his lovely cottage for almost a year, posting his selfies in the front page everyday, and getting paid for pretending to be the PM, Wow! What a happy year this is!"
"Contractors bidding for the job of distributing the vaccine have been told by Ottawa the work could go into the end of the second quarter in 2022, or June 2022.Is that reassuring folks ?"
"Yes! How long do you think it will take to manufacture and deliver 16,000,000,000 doses? If they can make 100 doses PER SECOND, it would take 1852 DAYS to make enough. That's more than three and a half years of 24/7 production."
"Until Trudeau clears the way for a public inquiry into WE, you can't believe a word he says."
"Lock yourself indoors, do not exercise, do not eat nutritional food, do not take vitamin D, C or zinc BUT make sure you take the vaccine."
"Most, but not all will have access by late 2021"
"just give me a laminated card for proof of inoculation. Please no smart phone app. Have you ever been lined up at the gate at Pearson when the hair buns try to find their boarding pass on their smart phone, Puleeze! (Cardboard boarding passes work faster. Who knew?"
"as quickly as possible. So Trudeau says we will be able to get shots soon after Health Canada approves a vaccine. That's great, but when will Health Canada approve the vaccine? And it's wonderful that we have freezers already, but they are empty. When can we expect to actually receive any vaccine? Because it really doesn't matter whether Health Canada has approved a vaccine or not if we don't have any to distribute. Canada is the only G20 country with no budget. We have the highest deficit per capita and as a share of GDP in the G20. We're in the bottom quarter when it comes to unemployment. We're one of the only developed countries that has failed to secure the right to produce any approved vaccine domestically. And we have no idea when we will have any vaccine to distribute. Thanks for nothing, Trudeau"
Vote Conservative!!
Can you imagine if we have Chinese vaccine in Canada
I wonder Chinese buying million of dollars of properties across Canada
"How serious can the pandemic be. Freeland and Trudeau have been chatter up how they plan to use this situation to promote their version of utopia. They’ve been doing this since day one, doubled down on it with the GG’s speech and have been shouting it since."
opposition critics and some premiers accuse his government of falling behind on a vaccine distribution plan. Opposition needs to step out of the way so our government can get some work done.
The only thing impeding the Liberal's distribution plan is the lack of a coordinated plan.
They're putting that together now. There is no vaccine yet. Take a chill pill.
How is the opposition stopping the government from doing anything?
"Trudeau has said a different thing each day. Two days ago he said we are near the back of the line, yesterday we were close to the front. No matter which day you choose he is still trying desperately to bury the WE scandal."
By taking up valuable time arguing in the house about utter nonsense.
"So you think Trudeau and his ministers are personally doing the work of procuring, approving and distributing the vaccine? The only job of Trudeau and his ministers is to be accountable to parliament for their policies and spending. Debate in parliament does not slow down the actual work of implementing those policies and spending decisions, which is carried out by legions of public servants."
That was really funny.
as quiuckly as possible. They havent done anything in 5 years...whats the difference?
Those who complain here are mostly the same who said this pandemic was a hoax and the virus only affects 0.00000000001% of the population. We need a vaccine for nonsense.
Statistics say that unless you are already on death's door you mostly likely will have a runny nose and maybe a cough. Do you not believe the statistics?
A good percentage of Canadians will receive a Covid vaccine--by next September and so stay cool!
What about the 400K plus newcomers coming to Canada next year?...will they recieve the vaccine first?
No world leaders want to deal with Chinese regime then why justin sign deal with China. Thanks God it did not go through
Now what does Angry Erin not understand about rolled out as quickly as possible and the vaccines will be procured in the first three months of the New Year and vaccinations will start in March and we have the freezers and syringes already in place?
"I think angry Erin has ""selective"" hearing. Happens when you are always looking for the negative."
the same as the rest of Canadians. How many time did we ask to get this response? now the question is it fact or just feel good words?
Erin has no idea when Health Canada will approve vaccines.
Still barking up the tree Cade? Where we you on the CF thread? Muted by the LPC perhaps?
I burst out laughing at the mere sight of Trump or Biden. I reflexively gag when I see JT or Kenney. Same basic reflex...just a different level of intensity.
"Oh so you're one of those types eh? Judge not, if you can do better get in there and do it, if not then just holdoff the un warranted critique."
"It's great to see that people on this forum think Trudeau is a pseudo dynastic politician riding his daddies coatails and intellect and the only thing special about him is his blood and his socks, otherwise he is a vacuous leader who isn't worthy to considered prime minister. as quickly as possible"
"A week ago many here were criticizing snowbirds heading south. Those same snowbirds will have access to the vaccine in a few weeks, for $49."
"Among the 15,000 people who received the placebo — a shot of saline that does nothing — 185 developed the novel coronavirus.’ .01 of the total."
"How long do you think it will take for 30,000 (the whole test group) people to get the virus naturally? 196 over 2 months is about what you can expect, even in the US with the virus essentially out of control. It is considered to be enough to be mathamatically significant. And remember, one person in the control group died so far. The reason why 'challenge' tests are considered unethical."
"Good point. How serious can it be. We know who is most effected, by and large 99% of the population won’t be severely impacted with the virus but rather the lockdown."
Will Trudeau and family the first ones to get the shot? I hope they set the example.
"They will, but because they want to set the examble"
Sophie takes injections already!
By that dude inn Quebec? Did she ever return to skippy?
"Here is the National Institute of Healths (US) news release on the trial. Why does this article give different numbers? Are the placebo group numbers alarming to you? An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) overseeing the Phase 3 trial of the investigational COVID-19 vaccine known as mRNA-1273 reviewed trial data and shared its interim analysis with the trial oversight group on Nov. 15, 2020. This interim review of the data suggests that the vaccine is safe and effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in adults. The interim analysis comprised 95 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 among volunteers. The DSMB reported that the candidate was safe and well-tolerated and noted a vaccine efficacy rate of 94.5%. The findings are statistically significant, meaning they are likely not due to chance. 90 of the cases occurred in the placebo group and 5 occurred in the vaccinated group. There were 11 cases of severe COVID-19 out of the 95 total, all of which occurred in the placebo group."
I realize that. I'm wondering why the numbers differ in this news article from the official release?
"That was an older report before they had enough infections to apply for approval. On 30 November Moderna gave an updated report with enough infections to be relevant. As more data comes in, it will also be reported, probably for 2 years."
"The situation would be more clear, I would feel more reassured, if reporters would never ask Trudeau a question. As quickly as possible"
But he is so handsome! Handsome! And his socks! They are colorful! That is JOURNALISM!
"8% of Canadians will get the first shot in Feb-March, second dose in MAy. Other 92% will get first shot in Sept at earliest, possibly November. Second shot will go into 2022 at which time Covid will have gone away on its own"
"Here you go Nick, since you need to be taken by the hand and shown the way:"
I have looked and found nothing what you claim on any of the usual trusted news sites.
"With Patty's graphic arts background ,the packaging of these vaccines will be awesome!"
"O'Toole said ""Canada should never have trusted the Chinese in the first place"" - about time one of our politicians is starting to speak the truth in relation to the Chinese."
Its starting to look like we should have partnered with the Russians.. who knew?
Maybe Trump was right ?
"He helped negotiate a trade deal with China. Should China lose money, according to Article 11 within the deal China can sue Canada for lost revenues. Canada does not have that option. On a good note, the deal expires in 2045. Surely you must be joking?"
as quickly as possible. We might just as well place a wig of dark wavy hair on a head of lettuce and place it in front of the teleprompter.
But his blood makes him special....his blood!
Prince Charles is royalty; don't much care for him either.
The woke left would sub kale for lettuce.
That would be an improvement.
Lately the colour swatch has changed to an auburn tone so a bit of variety will keep it from being boring - not really -platitudes delivered by a ventriloquist head of lettuce will still be boring.
"Too many people are playing partisan games with the very serious question of why Canada cannot produce COVID vaccines. PM Trudeau himself blames Harper, because it was during Harper's tenure as PM that private sector pharmaceutical manufacturers left Canada. However, there is no evidence that any policy of the Harper government was responsible for that. It was the Mulroney government that privatized Connaught Laboratories, Canada's government-run pharmaceutical lab, in 1986. The Trudeau Liberals themselves are not blameless. Trudeau spent $44 million to co-develop a vaccine with China, but then China refused to allow shipment of the vaccine to Canada for trials. Trudeau announced another $120 million in August, saying it would enable the domestic production of vaccines starting in November. That failed too, for unknown reasons. The Trudeau government also failed to secure domestic production rights in any of its vaccine procurement contracts. NDP leader Singh just held a press conference blaming both Conservatives and Liberals for Canada's lack of vaccine production capacity, but the NDP escapes blame only because they have never been in government. Singh called for a Crown corporation like Connaught Labs to be re-established, but he also cited Australia as an example of a country similar to Canada that is producing its own COVID vaccines domestically, while failing to mention that vaccine production in Australia, as well as the US, UK, India, Belgium, and most other G20 countries, is being done entirely by the private sector. So the real question that has to be answered is why pharmaceutical companies don't find Canada an attractive place to set up shop. Let's stop the partisan nonsense and get to the bottom of it. "
Failure of government. People are the losers.
Thanks Trudeau.
Sarcasm?
He doesn't know but keeps leading Canadians down the road. As quickly as possible
"With the economy going down and debt piling up by the billion every months thank to free money giveaways, it is not acceptable that he is not coming out with a exact date for vaccination. As quickly as possible"
the economy would of collapsed already if it wasnt for the free money.. if you look at history - all civilizations collapse after debasing their currency
JT the vaccine will distribute itself
as quickly as possible is still not a date other countries are ready in 1-2 weeks t start what are we doing here? We are running programs that drive debt every month. Get it done.
"Someones gotta rep. the little dog in this fight. Thanks to Corona, Flu, Pneumonia, and ""Vape Lung"" are all but non existent in 2020. Top that off with our educations long overdue modernization, and health care reviving funding nearly on par with the pre Harper era.Maybe we shouldn't be so fast to label corona as bad, who knows what other problems it can solve, if given the chance.  our debt with china... pretty safe to say we, as well as the rest of the world, are square now"
"False. Harper increased health transfers to the provinces by 6% each and every year he was PM, starting with his first budget in 2006."
The only 33% reduction in federal health transfers to the provinces happened under the Chretien-Martin Liberals in the 90s. Harper restored funding and increased it far beyond previous levels.
"RE Drinking water targets. Liberals won't meet their promises""? Like anybody is surprised about that or any other Trudeau promise! As quickly as possible"
It Trudeau was an officer on the battle field his own troops would frag him. As quickly as possible
You won't ever find a Trudeau on any battlefield.
only in the movies.
he would be leading from the rear.
"It was the first time I allowed myself to cry,"" oh! that brings a tear. thank you to all the researchers working behind the scenes to create something most of us have been waiting for....THANK YOU!"
"With recent polls showing that a sizeable number of Canadians will refuse a vaccine altogether, or will wait some time before lining up for a shot, so get lists up and running now so those of us who are willing to get vaccinated have our name on the list"
The reality is if even 50% of the population is vaccinated the desired outcome will occur.
As quickly as possible clean drinking water on reserves? I don't believe him and nor should anyone else.
"all levels of government need to start clearly identifying who gets the vaccine and having people enrol if they wish to get it , do this before so the list are clear and there are not confusing statement made and empty or crowded vaccination centres"
We don't want to be first with any new vaccine. Let someone else discover any hidden adverse effects before we get the vaccine.
that is what the researchers (and government regulations) are doing now.
The past has shown the the Trudeau family will soon see another windfall while we wait and wait and wait. as quickly as possible
JT & Santa go hand in hand a mere wish list. We sat on the fence when it came to initial outbreak & PPE. Now history repeats itself with the vaccine boggling and no I didn't vote Con so save your efforts.
Come back when you have something intelligent to say
"Justin, the UK just approved the Pfizer vaccine. Why has Health Canada not approved the same vaccine in Canada? What is the hold up? Waiting for delivery of our supply so you won't be embarrassed? as quickly as possible"
Because the UK was willing to forego the usual approval process. No other country is doing that besides maybe Russia. If Trudeau overrode the approval process and something went wrong would you say that it was ok? I am thinking not.
"They are working on approval. The last thing we want is to rush the approval process, only to discover later on that there are hidden adverse effects."
"he answered that question a few times over, herbert. canada has it's own standards."
Vaccines are going to be rolled out in quite a few countries next week. The excuses are wearing thin. as quickly as possible
Do your own research.
"yeah, that's what I thought. If you can't name them yet you make claims saying several countries next week and can't back it up..it makes you full of it."
"Now go do your own homework. Hint, Google will reveal all."
the US is meeting to talk about the UK's approval of the vaccine next week. It is not starting vaccinating people. Mexico is in the same boat. Just about every country is hoping to have people vaccinated by next September-ish.
I said next week
"43 minutes ago — The UK is the first country to approve the Pfizer vaccine. Come on JT, what's the hold up in Canada? as quickly as possible"
The PM has nothing to do with approving vaccines. Nor should he. Health Canada will grant approvals or not when they are satisfied.
"i know, it's just fun winding up the left. LOL"
Funny how making the right look dumb is the way to rile the left
Come now. Don't be naive. JT has attempted to influence supposedly independent bodies before. What makes you think he wouldn't do it again to avoid political embarrassment.
just as i suspected...you need a new hobby
"Yeah he has nothing to do with the AG either but that didn't stop him for trying to get a deal for SNC. Sorry, i don't trust him at all."
"Now the Mexicans are ready to roll on Pfizer, commence vaccinations of all health care workers Dec 11, then high risk and seniors. Gen pop to begin in January, kids and millennials go last"
millenials are fine as they self isolate in their parents lower level gaming all day and collecting Lib cash handouts.
"Lockdowns + Universal income = Majority. Majority - Universal Income = Our Future. J.t. is a Con, in Libs clothing. Hes lost all respect, and is going to have to rely on the promise tax dollars, to garner any votes. From now on, in voting Green, or bust!"
Pigs have a better chance at flying.
"What level of capacity strain was out public health system under this time 2019/2018 with admissions for regular Influenza A/B? Keep in mind, our public health system has been under capacity stress for a decade giving the rapidly aging population in Canada and care this requires"
"interesting to see 2019/2018 pneumonia complicated deaths from influenza A/B set against COVID complicated deaths. Plus how many cases, if we ever kept track, of people to were admitted to the health care system with influenza A/B severity during this time frame in the past two years."
"Trudeau says vaccines will roll out as quickly as possible after Health Canada approvals. Well, I would certainly hope so"
Canada will be still waiting for the vaccine long after Health Canada approves. Thanks JT! LOL
"Britain and US have both already approved the Pfizer vaccine for distribution. Once again we're behind the 8 ball - typical for this government. They're lightning fast at shoveling out the money, but for finding solutions, not so much. as quickly as possible"
Have they? Britain has granted emergency approval just today and I'm not sure that covers general distribution. I haven't heard anything about a US approval.
"US has not approved, yet, Mexico has this am though"
43 minutes ago — The UK is the first country to approve the Pfizer vaccine
"Health Canadas approval process was set up to be independent of political influence. In the US and UK politics can truly fast track drugs. Slow action on approving drugs in Canada is they way the system is, trying to blame it on the current Government is wrong. The whole system would have to be changed for this to happen, and I'd rather a heath Canada system that looks out for Canadians be in control, not a Politician that gets ""Donations"" from big Pharma."
Big Pharma wins regardless of the timing.
The US has scheduled to distribute 20 million doses by the end of December.
Let's use what they are using in China. Apparently it's working very well.
"He is no rush, plan is to delay to inflict max damage to Ford to diminish Con brand in vote rich Ontario. Summer election, JT will time release just before that..for now, he is sitting on sidelines, letting the Premiers take all the flack. as quickly as possible"
And letting Canadians die.
"Devils Advocate... Corona is a good thing! No flu, pneumonia, or ""vape lung"" this year. Our education system is finally getting a long overdue modernization, and funding is going back to heath care at levels the meet pre Harper.If we could just convince those at risk to protect themselves, as opposed to expecting others to protect them, corona would be more silver lining than cloud!"
You might want to check some actual facts before you spout off about Harper. Harper guaranteed annual Health Care transfer increases of annual inflation or 3% per year during his term.Stop believing the Liberal gossip.
"as quickly as possible. Bottom line, our Liberals put pandering to China ,that great Democracy and defender of human rights and the rule of law, ahead of the well being of Canadians. And apparently Liberals knew they would never come through as they didn't even bother creating a distribution plan. So incompetence getting it + incompetence delivering it = more Canadian deaths."
 All I read was conservatives slander and whining. We have a compassionate and empathic PM and you don't like that
 All I hear is a Liberal in total agreement by failing t rebut. After 5 years you can't name a single success and still you pretend.
"as quickly as possible. We'll all believe this when the refrigeration units are all here and when the vaccines are on Canadian soil, not before."
"Let us maintain clear perspective ! This Covid 19 vaccine issue like many other issues (that effect Canadians re their Health, prosperity, social and mental welfare at large)are not partisan LIB or CON or NDP Sectors. We all as Canadians deserve intelligent, competent, accountable leadership that exudes integrity. God bless"
Maybe next time.
"I agree with you. But unfortunately, I don't think we're getting that."
"The only question is ""why did our govt sign on for a Chinese vaccine considering their treatment of Canada and the world instead of more reliable trustworthy western providers."
"I'm not sure its the only question, but perhaps it looked like a promising solution at the time"
At the time it was the furthest along in development.
"So the Got jailed our citizens, has committed unspeakable human rights violations , spying, theft and tyranny said they had a good vaccine. Seriously?"
So far advanced it's still non existent. Hedging our bets like other countries by signing up to multiple sources would be simple common sense
Canada through the NRC has worked with CanSio BIO on other vaccine development so they were viewed as a good science partner the political system well they just messed things up. That is the risk in doing business in countries like China.
as quickly as possible. The results speak for themselves. Vaccinations are starting next week. We backed the wrong vaccine programs. Stunning that we went along with a Chinese government vaccine and not what is being developed in the here in the west. Even more stunning is our government chose now to renovate the facilities of vaccine producers in Canada thus shutting down their production capabilities. Of course Trudeau blames the Ghost of Stephen Harper for his own incompetence.
Wonderful that's just great so why not sign on to other companies just in case.You know like the entire western hemisphere did.
They are funding development in Canada like here in Edmonton Alberta were one is expected to hit clinical trials early 2021. The feds clearly stated early on their desire to have a made in Canada solution so that Canada would control a vaccine and not be dependent on other countries and licensing agreements.
If you think breaking a contract is costly try breaking a licensing agreement.
as quickly as possible. UK is getting theirs this week. You can't possibly believe that nonsense after 5 years of dishonesty rejection of the rule of law and unending failure. incompetence
The UK is allowing for Emergency use only. That is quite different than universal use.
"Yes, the results speak for themselves. Vaccinations will start next week in a jurisdiction where approval was granted today. Health Canada could grant approval at any time and then our vaccinations will start as well. While we initially went with what was at the time seen as the most promising potential vaccine that contract was cancelled in May and we went with several other options from other companies. Also I'm not clear on how many vaccine production labs we had or how much control the government had over them. Were they not private companies able to make their own decisions? "
"as quickly as possible, incompetence. And Canada is behind 2.5 billion people every G-7 country in existence and has no distribution plan. As always a total unmitigated failure."
"Please, we have no vaccine to approve and if we did we'd have to wait for our turn. I guess maybe we could spend the time creating a distribution method, eh? Oh Chretien ran on and ended patent protection ending Canadian research"
"Just a reminder of a fact that quite a few people here seem to be forgetting is Justin Trudeau's public statement that he holds ""a certain respect"" for China and it's administration, That says a lot!"
"Our leadership STRANGELY put all it's eggs in one Chinese basket. So, the govt. who created the global mess ,is holding Canadians illegally and rejects a global demand for an investigation is the Govt the Liberals decide to climb into bed with. All that Chinese money pumped into the PET foundation and Liberal election campaigns really paid off."
So we didn't put in orders with various companies from a number of countries as the article suggests? Instead we're still committed to a deal the article claims was cancelled months ago? Where are you getting your data? Perhaps you should share it with the authors of this and other articles that disagree.
They only placed those orders for vaccines after China pulled out of the agreement with Canada. It really was a strange arrangement and put us behind most of the world with the vaccines that are starting to get approved.
"Really you aren't aware that this govt signed an exclusive deal with China that only ended in May when a Canada bound flight carrying their vaccine here for testing was blocked by Chinses officials. Kindly explain why with Chinese record on human rights, spying, theft , jailing our citizens and turning a regional virus into a pandemic wax the choice of our Govt,. Details please! Oh we are now behind 2.5 billion people every G-7 nation in existence and still have no distribution plan.. "
"Oh I'm aware of all that, but in April and May access to a working vaccine probably seemed more important than the flaws in the source. Nor do we appear to be behind everyone else according to statements from some of the companies involved. As to a distribution plan I'd be surprised if we didn't have several plans to allow for the various handling requirements of whichever vaccines get approved and delivered and in what order in in what amounts. There are a lot of variables and publishing Plan A through Plan K would be confusing"
That's fine but that does not explain why our Govt didn't do what every other govt in the entire western hemisphere did and signed on to multiple sources to cover it's bets.UK gets their vaccine this week I guess we are too eh? It wouldn't matter we still don't have a distribution method.
"What are you talking about? We've got 7 sources lined up. None of them are China since the Chinese contract was cancelled in May. The UK approval agency just signed off today and others, including Health Canada, could follow at any time. And there's a difference between not publishing the plan and not having a plan. There are still a lot of variables for delivery and people tend to get upset by changes to the plan even if those changes are driven by changing variables."
as quickly as possible. incompetence. The Chinese deal fell through in May THEN we started signing up. Now unless COVID started in May then this Govt blew it. With his unending failures your telling me this govt has a distribution plan but won't tell us?. Out of Humility I suppose. .5 years and not a single success and still you won't face reality.
as quickly as possible. The word salad king.
Trudeau says and Trudeau does are quite often 2 completely different things
"as quickly as possible, incompetence, The UK first to roll out a vaccine from Pfizer ,Gee Canada could have been on that list. All that massive debt and no vaccine in sight or distribution method. Brilliantly typical Liberal performance. Apparently their first 4 years of unending failure might have been a hint a to future failures."
as quickly as possible. Incompetence. The king of vague ambiguous generalizations has spoken.
How about a 'target' date that you're working on? That's what you do in business.
"Still comes down to ""I don't know"", especially when it depends on factors out of his control. Also the stakes are lower in business. Its just money."
There's a big difference
"Really ""I DON'T KNOW means signing up to multiple sources to cover your bets. Jt did not ."
Funny that this article claims that we've signed up with 7 sources rather than just a cancelled contract with China.
I wouldn't be comfortable if I thought Health Canada was working toward a target date or expediting the approval process. That sort of thing might be ok in producing a new widget but health isn't business. The stakes are higher.
"Target dates, expediting, making business deals. not exactly what career politicians have experience in."
"You can't 'get' something without working on it. IF the concern is safety, then ok, raise the bar, but do some WORK for Gods sake"
"And what work should the PM, the PMO or the government do to get approval from Health Canada? Political pressure to approve early perhaps? Skip Health Canada entirely and simply grant approval themselves? Declare Britain's approval as good enough? I'll wait thanks."
Its approved in UK for 'emergency' use only.
And the cow jumped over the moon and other Liberal cya stories.
"What does as quickly as possible actually mean? To me, it suggests that JT is admitting that the government no longer has any real control over the timing of access to vaccines once they are approved. Quite an accomplishment for a supposedly developed country. incompetence"
Its really the manufacturers who control the timing of deliveries to any country isn't it?
"No, those in countries that have signed licensing agreements - which Canada did not do - will get access based on their domestic ability to produce the vaccines. And those in countries that develop and produce their own vaccines - which Canada could once but no longer can do - will clearly get prioritized access, as JT admitted last week."
"Where one is on the priority list still doesn't give one control of the timing of the manufacture. Order of delivery yes, timing no."
But it's the govts obligation to at least get on the list. How's Jt doing?
Actually mark our brain trust decided to put all it's eggs in one Chinese basket and here we are.
My understanding is that we've been on various lists since August.
The Chinses deal fell through in May when the Chinese blocked a Canadian bound flight carrying their vaccine here fur testing. Why in Gods name would these Liberals sign up with China and not far more qualified a dependable Western companies.
"It's pretty obvious we're not on the priority list for any of these reputable major companies, when they know the first people JT went to was communist China in searching for a vaccine. He stepped in it again, and it will likely cost Canadian lives."
"We'll likely 'follow' the hierarchy the US is using; front line health workers, other care givers, care-homes, workers in essential businesses (like food), vulnerable people, then oldest down to youngest. This doesn't happen overnight."
Maybe they can beg for some doses to get our front line healthcare workers vaccinated this month.
as quickly as possible. Incompetence. May I remind you that Trudeau does NOT know when or how much we are going to get?......As for a purchasing agent he has failed miserably......this is just one example.
"hopefully we are not using the one that england just approved, better to wait a bit and get one you do only once a year and can keep it in a fridge"
usually when you rush you make mistakes
Does anyone? Mr Johnson seems to be in much the same situation and his approval agency cleared the vaccine there today.
I suppose prudence is the only defence Trudeau has after he was so late in securing this vaccine.
Was he late? At the time several months ago it appeared we were fairly early in the ordering process.
 I said we will likely follow the 'hierarchy' of who gets the vaccine. I did't say when we would start.
He order in August which was months after other countries.
"Canada is such a joke. If you need proof, watch what happens over the next 5 years. Huge tax increases, multi generation home ownership horizons, no middle class unless you work for the government Big round of applause for ""saving us"" leftists!"
"The Cons are not going anywhere politically until they change a few things, and people forget about their past bad behavior. Here is a hint, stop calling people communists and leftists, or alt left."
Just wait for the 'closing tax loopholes' BS to pay for the 'we've got your back' hundreds or billions in new spending programs. Trudeau taking socialism to new sickening levels.
They did get the most votes in the last election so they're not that far away. Especially considering the dud of a leader they had.
"I'd suggest people stop BEING alt-left, leftists and communists."
And what about the Liberals past and present behavior? The list is too long to comment here. I would have to get a book publisher.
What does as quickly as possible mean? Trudeau is a serial lier. We know that. Incompetence
It means that vaccinations will start as soon as he has a way to personally profit from it. Incompetence
"We get them when we get them. Unless you are a front line worker, senior, or vulnerable what makes you think you were first in line?"
"when you are unqualified, not to mention incompetence, as quickly as possible may be a long long time"
They will roll out just like the clean drinking water promise. The Trudeau Liberals have zero credibility and more proof today.
when indiginous quick squandering and embezzling the billions they get from tax payers they will have enough$$$ to have clean drinking water
"if trudeau says it, it must be true. As quickly as possible, incompetence"
"incompetence, Any comment beginning with ""Trudeau says"" should be relegated to the scrap pile of empty Liberal promises. Ask ALL the indigenous reserves about that clean water they have been ""promised"" for over 25 years."
Remember way back before March....The world was warned of the Covid Outbreak in China and Canada was the last to get their citizens out of Ground Zero....So much so they were a month behind the world getting our Citizens out....Then he brags about getting tens of thousands back home through bottle neck airports in Canada with no screening or warning of the declared Pandemic in Canada with 3 Provinces closed.
"as quickly as possible, incompetence. and a months long wait to get rapid testing and now months long wait to get vaccinated."
Total failure of this Govt to protect Canadians!!
I'm not sure total failure is entirely correct. One needn't look far afield to find significantly worse efforts.
Why is wanting a vaccine as quickly as possible for the worst pandemic in over 100yrs even considered partisan? Who could argue against that? Only a pure partisan ideologue would argue against getting our life back to normal as quickly as possible
"Only 1.5M worldwide dead, yeah not too bad. Geez"
"If it's bad enough to shut down our economy and rack up unprecedented debt, it's the worst in 100 years."
"It must be understood that when people raise concerns regarding safety of an expeditiously developed vaccine by novel methodology, it is not whining but valid expression of concern. If people raise concerns regarding unavailability of vaccine in CANADA for its citizens to be vaccinated unlike citizens of other developed countries like US UK Germany who are starting to get vaccinated ahead of Canadians..... .. it is not whining but valid display of concerns in this regard. This pandemic has brought forth and exposed deep failures of how our governments, Federal/Provincial/ local level, to deliver Health care services. Canadians were already suffering from unacceptable wait times of months or years for seeing a physician or a specialist or having serous surgery done or being treated for cancer - and now this Covid 19 vaccine related debacle.Current debacle to be devoid of capabilities to manufacture Covid 19 vaccine and then further failures to procure the vaccine developed and manufactured elsewhere is momentous failure on part of all levels of Governments - Federal, Provincial, Municipal- to look after heath and welfare of all Canadians.We can do it - I know when Canadians set their minds to any task they are capable of accompalishing it. I implore to politicians/appointed/annointed/hired dignitaries to not to let Canadians down and to please act intelligently and efficiently and compassionately to ensure health and welfare need of Canadians is looked after optimally. We can do better ! I know we can."
as quickly as possible. Incompetence. So for the next year the world will have to enact a Canadian travel ban. Good job Liberals
"Justin can't even get clean drinking drinking water to First Nations after promising to do so for 5 years, but yeah, he's got a woke vision for re-imagining Canada. Good grief, what a donkey"
"as quickly as possible. So how many more approvals does there need to be until it is approved 5, 10, 20 I just don't believe we won't get the vaccine until late next year or until 2022. In the mean time our Neighbors across the Border will be starting to vaccinate their population next Thursday. In a few weeks the UK will start doing their citizens in a few weeks."
"as quickly as possible, incompetence. Trudeau spends $billions and does not negotiate dates or quantity of vaccines?......What would you expect from a drama teacher"
Correct. Part-time Drama teacher. Better
Two degrees from Canadian universities and former high school French and mathematics teacher is accurate.
FIRED drama teacher is 100% accurate. Fired for cough undisclosed reasons
We will be getting our first vaccine shipment in April. 2 million doses. Enough for 1 million people.That's the reality.The US will be at herd immunity in May.
April if we're lucky
Trudeau will have a way to make some money from this by then I'm sure.
You will get the vaccine only after I am finish dishing out billions. Greasing party wheels and buying the next election
Funny how all the liberal supporters are saying there is no rush for the vaccine now. see how well propaganda works?
"as quickly as possible. Incompetence. Just asking, why are other countries perfectly capable of approving the vaccines in a more timely manner than Canada?"
"People whine and beach saying the vaccines were made too quickly and wouldn't be safe. (I'm not taking that - whimper-whimper). Then, when we're on the cusp of getting something that only needs final safety approvals the same people are whinin' and beachin' that its taking too long. You can't please these people. They enjoy whining too much."
A failure should be recognized
"I don't believe a word this guy says.....he has proven it time and time and time.....again! Incompetence, as quickly as possible"
"Hey JT, WE don't have a vaccine."
as quickly as possible. Incompetence. JT has promised by using taxpayers money he will get the vaccine to 3rd world countries. What a great guy.
"Yes, Captian Obvious. Have you got a deal worked out for the carbon tax on the delivery"
"The government announced the purchase of hundreds of million doses with great fanfare. They neglected, however, to indicate any semblance of a delivery schedule. All we know is 20 million doses will be delivered sometime in the first quarter of 2021. Absolutely no word on any other deliveries. I guess that's why JT and crew were so secretive in releasing any contact details. as quickly as possible, incompetence"
The US and the UK are starting vaccinations this week. I hope it will dawn on Canadians that the border closures are because of us not them
as quickly as possible. The silver spoon boy dealing with Covid has been spend money as fast as he can. and not working as he no leader. now with the vaccine mess up or unknowing. well i would say that the Members of the House be the last and their families to get a shot when it arrives. as we all know they shall be the first to get it. they will say they need to live to spend more of our money.
so far the only thing which is rolling as quickly as possible is the debt created by liberals
As quickly as possible.Basically JT is saying we have no idea
How incompetence would it be to demand a delivery date with no real idea when or if one or another vaccine might be approved? Remember that access to these vaccines was negotiated months ago.
"UK vaccination starts tomorrow, we can`t be very far behind, what a relief."
This little tidbit of information should appease the Con's concerns of not getting a vaccine because of It's speedy availability.
As quickly as possible he can get his buddies involved.
UK just announced they have approved Phizers vaccine and will start immunizing its citizens within days. We don't even have a date as to when we might get the first three million. Epic FAIL.. Incompetence. As quickly as possible
"Oh, for goodness sakes..........we will get the vaccine when it is ready and hopefully will be effective.......I agree with one person that I heard on CBC news the other day re the US starting their vaccines later this month.....she said that she would 'prefer' to wait out to see how the vaccine is working on individuals in the US....makes sense to me!"
The middleclass and small business will be extinct by then
"CBC story UK next week. British media have reported that hospitals in England have been told to get ready to start doing vaccinations for medical workers as early as next week. Canada not so much, Canadian healthcare workers being let do by Trudeau. as quickly as possible"
China and Russia have been giving vaccines for months. The Brits are getting ready. Gord ? He's just CONfused. He thinks this is a race.
"Ernie has been fibbing about other countries getting the vaccine fast: Zahawi declined to give any specific date for a vaccine rollout as none have yet been approved for public use."""
CBC story UK next week. British media have reported that hospitals in England have been told to get ready to start doing vaccinations for medical workers as early as next week.
"These vaccines have not been approved. They may get some kind of emergency allowance to be used on health care workers etc., but they have not been approved for use on the general public. Till then we just have to wait."
"Let's look at some of Trudeau's claims. August 30, 2020. PMO press release. preliminary production of 250,000 doses of vaccine per month starting in November 2020 One of the things to remember is Canada no longer has any domestic production capacity for vaccines, - JT November 24th."
Lack of an exact date does not mean they don't have a plan.
Are you saying O'Tool is telling stories the same as Trudeau? No one can spin a yarn like the podium puppet.
Trudeau says vaccines will roll out as quickly as possible What does that basic statement even mean for when we will actually get it?
"that means if you want to get it your place in the line depends on ""donations"" to his slush fund"
"as quickly as possible. Clearly Trudeau and his gov't have blown this and more than necessary people will die. Not that they didn't do their best, just that they were incompetence having no background of experience to manage our government and negoiate on the world stage."
"Hire people that can do and have the experience to run this country, not political folks with no real experience in managing anything of substance. How about a hospital, a manufacturing plant, a banker, but not lawyers and certainly NOT Journalist, DramaTeachers/media types, or a Graphic Artist."
So your a Trudeau trooper and you do not want to be vaccinated. Are you wearing a mask?
Morneau was an odd fit for them. Wonder if that's why he's gone. Seems anyone with brains has left. Jody... jane
"Unfortunately, the opportunity for improvement has passed. Our fate was sealed when the government did nothing until August, instead of relying upon the CanSino vaccine. Funny how we were going to be able to produce vaccines domestically when that was announced, however, we now supposedly have no capabilities for domestic production. Guess it was a good thing that deal failed as we wouldn't have been able to produce it domestically if you believe what we are currently being told"
if I was a liberal attached to the Trudeau government I would be really nervous. He's warming up the buses and figuring out who to sacrifice to save himself.
"""It took more than a generation to pay for Trudeau père's largess: under Jean Chrétien, Paul Martin and Stephen Harper, federal spending averaged 13 per cent of GDP."" Those being born today will still be paying for a government their grand parents voted to support."
This is a world event. the whole world is in economic distress
Good thing those born now have no clue what their life will be like. A true Trudeau recruit.
"If the premiers vaccinate in the right order starting with health care workers we should get this under control to the point were we can get back to somewhat normal. Our life as we once knew it is over. Going forward will be different. I,m hoping better."
"Based on the statements of industry officials my best guess is that Canada will start to receive shipments by March. But how long will it take Health Canada to approve it? And how will it be divided among the provinces (by population, share of vulnerable demographics, rate of infection, etc.)? And what segments of the population will get it first? If Trudeau doesn't start clearly laying out how this is going to work, he is going to leave some provinces and demographic groups very disappointed and the rest ungrateful. "
"Thanks for that. It is far more than Trudeau is willing to say. There has also been musing about prioritizing First Nations, public school teachers and students and other groups."
"Politicians from opposite political parties are squabbling over getting this rushed vaccine to Canadians. I think they will be surprised, when they find out, just how many Canadians will not be willing to submit to a vaccine for a virus that has a 99.8% survival rate."
"The vaccines are safe? After you, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, your family, your cabinet ministers and their families. I say we try the vaccines out on our politicians and see if they turn green, gasp for breath or suffer any adverse effects. If they don't, then we can give the vaccine to the rest of the population."
"Way better than cons, all attack and no policy. O'toole wants an exact date on a vaccine that hasnt been approved yet"
No he's not. That's Trump.
 And you make excuses for the lackey who has others tie his shoes. Are you better?
If you haven't noticed they are both narcissists. It's all about them.
 When I see JT's competition I am glad she is PM. Seriously look at his competition.
"when you attempt to make him look smart I realise it's useless to discuss who's better. O'Tool is untried. Who knows what he can do. We,ve seen Trudeau's game since 2015. It speaks volumes."
"Way better than cons, all attack and no policy. Learn something Opposition parties do not make policies."
"I am all for replacing JT if you can bring a solid opponent. As for o'toole if he had some policy he might get some credibility. When you only attack and offer nothing as a solution, you cant lead"
Opposition parties propose policies and plans. Cons cant do that
" Trump, Trudeau, basically the same type of person."
"as quickly as possible. Incompetence. If we see vaccinations starting in early January, your off the hook Trudeau. If you do not get it started till September you better have your bags packed and looking for a place to rent."
"Just watch an episode of the British TV series ""Yes Prime Minister"" ... a highly accurate depiction of how our country is run."
"I'm not putting all my eggs in the vaccine basket. Until it's actually being jabbed into millions of Canadian arms I'll outwit, outplay and outlast Covid. The strategy and tactics are pretty simple, social distancing, hand washing and mask wearing."
"In this COVID-19 pandemic, keeping Canadians safe means getting a vaccine as quickly as possible, but it also means making sure that the vaccine is safe for Canadians,"" Trudeau said '"" Yep, that's why Mr. Trudeau, Ms. Hajdu and the Cabinet should be the first recipients of the vaccine; then we will all follow suit."
"The vaccine comes when it comes. The political game that's evolved is ridiculous but was inevitable. It's like crying out ""when is next year going to arrive?"". Partisan politics is a sad spectacle to witness and the general populace are tired of it, most people want to yell out ""Get Real!"". Can't politicians look in the mirror and see how ridiculous they come across?"
"10,000 Chinese soldiers parish for every Canadian covid death; let's go."
"You know how many people around the world are respectful of Trudeau and Freeland's leadership? None, None"
"The psychiatric term is ""projection"" and you just did it over 7 billion times. It must be tiring."
So says the Chinese conspirator. Stick to China.
Can you imagine if he lived in China and wrote that about Presdident Xi Jinping in a national newspaper.
"It is not unlikely that he lives in China and is acting on behalf of the Xi gov,t"
Other news sources are reporting exactly that. Talking about how it will be rationed to the most vulnerable and their caretakers in long term care. But we also know Mr Trudeau will be among the first in Canada to get it.
"I'd ask you prove that, but we know that facts are not a Liberal strength."
Canada has a firm order for 20 million doses from Moderna. They are only shipping 2 million or 10% of the order by April 1. If that is the front of the line I would sure hate to be at the back of the line. Fake news....where does that info come from
Beijing blocked shipments of vaccine samples meant to be used in clinical trials in Canada. Withdraw all visas and expropriate the home of foreign Chinese. Why do the Liberals keep thinking that they can trust our enemies.
Trudeau still looking for the path to Shangri La and needs their help
China knows a spineless jellyfish when they see one.
"Quick, Kill me now. With the limitless spending ahead, I'm not waiting for the vaccine to save me. Living through years of a welfare state would be too painful"
"You will be waiting a long time for Trudeau to come through with anything he promises if you haven’t noticed by now. As quickly as possible, incompetence"
He has to wait for the Halal version or he loses his GTA seats.
can you spare some vaccine? And he wonders why they hang up on him.
"Credit to Trudeau not easy being PM during a crisis like this, still he has a 90% approval for his handling of the Covid situation and making sure Billions of dollars went to Canadians' pockets directly rather than money Hoarders in boardrooms at Bay Street."
What 90% of two hundred liberals? I guess that's pretty high.
I guess if you poll liberals you would get a result like that..unfortun CBC fudges their poll results to keep their jobs if they keep reporting pro lib media
"I'm going to repeat this, One of two things. Those on here defending Trudeau are either being paid... Or they are in a cult. This government is a travesty! As quickly as possible. Incompetence"
"opposition critics and some premiers accuse his government of falling behind on a vaccine distribution plan. O'Toole decided for himself to pursue the most pressing issues...delivery dates.Meanwhile the cohort of Con is withholding millions of federal money from doctors and nurses(Kenney) and topping up Con salaries with a $1.6 million dollar round table covid committee, sans scientific expertise, comprising of Con bureaucrats and MPPs (Ford).Does the name Dean French come to mind when you heard of this."
The provincial parties have nothing to do with the federal parties. Please review grade 10 social studies.
how much do you get paid per post to defend the libs?
Americans already have a shipment in Chicago from Belgium.FDA approved and off they go while our Govt plays Patty Cake.
"Just two days ago Trudeau said we would not get the vaccine until after most other countries, then liberals said it was Harper's fault followed by their claim it was Mulroney's fault. Now it seems to be Trudeau's fault after all, just don't know which one."
"incompetence, Just 2 days ago Trudeau admitted he had dropped the ball on the COVID vaccines, now he is singing a different tune. As quickly as possible"
The spinmeisters have gone to work with the support of seebesee.
Take your time and get it right. Better to wait a little longer than take a vaccine that is fast tracked and may not be as advertised. Let the Americans be Canada's guinea pigs.
After all were only paying customers we deserve a working product before the cash is Authorized.
O'Toole is borrowing from the Trump playbook except that he's falling flat on his face. But the neck beards still believe anything he says.
"Hmmmm. How would anyone compare Trump to any Canadian representative? Two totally different systems and in spite of Trump, theirs is way better simply it is by the people for the people that is what Trump actually likes about our system is the ""monarchy""(he could just stay in the background). It would give him what he likes total power. Trump is gone and our monarchy keeps on going. This from a Canadian Conservative and yes I way prefer O'Toole over Trudeau any day. Cheers"
"I wish you all good health, but that doesn't come from a pill or a syring"
"Trudeau says”.... I stopped listening to this poser about the same time I stopped listening to Trump. Incompetence, as quickly as possible"
Anand: Vaccine delivery dates are being negotiated now. I can only hope that she informed the military and provinces. Not likely given this cabal.
"as quickly as possible, incompetence. Trudeau opens his mouth over half of Canada tunes him out. Pretending he should remain PM is all you are doing, Pretending."
The half that are laughing are busy growing their neck beards.
PM BF speak with fork tongue
They have to wait the green lights from regulators and Vaccine experts in addition to receiving a notice of immenent shipments my guess.
"There's also this little tidbit having something to do with the manufacturer giving us a shipping date. Not sure the CPC method, schedule vaccine appointment for the 1st, company ships vaccine on the 8th, is all that efficient."
"Where’s my pony, Justin promised me a pony."
After Health Canada approvals? Is that the same Health Canada that the Trudeau government is now responsible for?
Great I will remember that when the CRA keeps harassing me for payment...I told you I will make payment as quickly as possible.
Wonder why Trudeau mislead parliament today when he falsely claimed that the cancellation of the CanSino deal left Canada with contracts with 7 companies when in fact we only had contracts with 2 companies at the time?
"His message is 2021 for me and 2022 for thee. Poor planning on his teams part means regular Canadians should suffer. Incompetence, as quickly as possible"
"I think there should be several discrete review groups to determine the roll out. It will and should be different in each province or territory. For example in Manitoba, Winnipeg has a large poor indigenous population and as poor people are more at risk the city should include poor and indigenous poor in the first 3 or 4 groups to get vaccine.In remote areas where there is no current high infection these can be better helped with an enhanced health control process to stop infections from taking hold.In areas that are infected and hard to get to, then vaccinate everyone not infected. In large cites in moderate climates like Vancouver or Victoria the homeless and poor should be hing on the priority lists.I do think though we should retain 10% of vaccines to sell to the ultra rich families, business execs and any others with buckets of money so they can skip the queue for 2-5,000's or more.
The justification is that we can't completely segregate the groups for example is a mild 68 year old asthmatic to be included under the 'at risk' group, I do not think so.We can reduce the debt by allowing rich and influential people to buy the vaccine for them selves or their friends, just put a cap on the amount we allow for greed"
"incompetence, as quickly as possible. And when the vaccine is delayed even further, JT will say, ""I'm very very very very mad"""
I'm sure he'll find a way to blame Stephen Harper.
The moment the vaccine is approved Trudeau will immediately be rolling out all 72 doses in Canada's first allotment!
"Not 'funny'. Oh and I hope you are way, way down on the to get it list"
You are correct Phillip the LIBERAL incompetence is not funny!
"as quickly as possible, incompetence. Does anyone believe a single word Trudeau says any more? Anyone?"
right. A liberal deadline promise. About as believable as their clean drinking water promises.
As quickly as possible means absolutely nothing.
"China has played a major role in ripping off Canadians when it comes to vaccine technology. China has infiltrated the system, and then refuses to ship the vaccine, Chinese nationals have stolen intellectual property in exchange for big payouts from the CCP. This is a form of biological warfare. And it is a big sign that Trudeau is a weak leader. China has infiltrated every aspect of Canadian life. Something must be done about Chinese nationals in every important institution."
China's leaders know that Trudeau is a weak leader and by virtue of this Canada is seen as a weak country. It's shocking that so many Lib supporters don't seem to realize this.
JT is Xi's punching bag
"Trudeau announces today, BORDERS TO STAY CLOSED FOR A LONG TIME. Johnson announces UK TO START COVID VACCINATION MONDAY. Notice any difference in the two realities?"
Just not ready. Incompetence
Trudeau will never be ready. Incompetence
"Too many people are playing partisan games with the very serious question of why Canada cannot produce COVID vaccines. PM Trudeau himself blames Harper, because it was during Harper's tenure as PM that private sector pharmaceutical manufacturers left Canada. However, there is no evidence that any policy of the Harper government was responsible for that. It was the Mulroney government that privatized Connaught Laboratories, Canada's government-run pharmaceutical lab, in 1986. The Trudeau Liberals themselves are not blameless. Trudeau spent $44 million to co-develop a vaccine with China, but then China refused to allow shipment of the vaccine to Canada for trials. Trudeau announced another $120 million in August, saying it would enable the domestic production of vaccines starting in November. That failed too, for unknown reasons. The Trudeau government also failed to secure domestic production rights in any of its vaccine procurement contracts. NDP leader Singh just held a press conference blaming both Conservatives and Liberals for Canada's lack of vaccine production capacity, but the NDP escapes blame only because they have never been in government. Singh called for a Crown corporation like Connaught Labs to be re-established, but he also cited Australia as an example of a country similar to Canada that is producing its own COVID vaccines domestically, while failing to mention that vaccine production in Australia, as well as the US, UK, India, Belgium, and most other G20 countries, is being done entirely by the private sector. So the real question that has to be answered is why pharmaceutical companies don't find Canada an attractive place to set up shop. Let's stop the partisan nonsense and get to the bottom of it. "
As quickly as possible Is it possible to be anymore vague!
As quickly as possible = I don’t have a clue.
"O'Toole said Canada should have never trusted the Chinese in the first place. While O'Toole is picking fights with one of Canada's biggest exports partners.Canada is struggling with a pandemic of a lifetime and potential worldwide economic collapse of markets.Way to go CON WAR ROOM, you've managed to slide right back into your trenches looking for battles."
Trudeau destroyed the relationship and your blame game is pathetic
I see your not in the “markets” apparently.
Canada's biggest problem is our government doesn't understand the difference between right and wrong.
"You would blame Canada for a ""breakdown"" with China? Go back to sleep"
And our ethically challenged Prime Minister continues to us COVID as an excuse to hide the truth about WE.
"Wrong time to fight China since we technically don't need them now to help sort out their global Pandemic mess, we have 3 potential Vaccines all from Western allies, China could actually be the Trojan horse we need as you alluded to buy our oil as the world economy and certainly the Chinese economy recovers our next focus should be how do we began exports of our commodities the Chinese need asp."
The economy was in tatters before the pandemic...and Trudeau/Freeland is going to jolt it?This won't end well for most Canadians
Parliament needs to muzzle lobbyists NOW.
Well I'm sure a fund raising event in your riding would grease the wheels.....who ever should the proceeds go to tho?
If I tried a fund raising event in my riding for the LPC....it wouldn't pay for the coffee
Clinging to power is more important then doing what is right for this country. Liberals are a disgrace.
"That's why they basically dared the Con for an election... I wouldn't call that ""clinging"""
visions of Stephen Harper holding a last minute spectacle with the Ford's.I think your problem is projection
We are so lucky we Have Justin and the Liberals in charge
Scotty should check JT's approvals on the corona virus
"I see his disapproval rating is pretty high among those trying to make it look like their party is still relevant. Everyone else is looking at other countries being run by that party or similar and thanking the lord we don't have it that bad.Let's see, USA, run by a conservative. How they doing?United Kingdom, run by a conservative. How they doing? Brazil, run by a conservative .... you get the idea."
"as quickly as possible, incompetence. one vaccine manufacturer says Canada isn’t at the back of the line and the liberals have no plan, this is not good news."
"I will bash TAM for a decade. I am in BC, and I have dealt with numerous people not educated in Canada's healthcare practices and she fits at the bottom of the pyramid in BC."
"Trudeau says a lot of things, Trudeau has zero credibility. As quickly as possible, incompetence"
"The Trudeau Cabinet should get vaccines first: two shots, one month apart. If they are OK let the seniors go next!"
"The Trudeau Cabinet should get vaccines first: two shots, one month apart. If they are OK let the seniors go next!"
My plan is lets vaccinate the politicians and MSM first. If they don’t die then the vaccine is safe. If they do die the country is safe.
"LOL! as quickly are possible Wow, that is a real commitment!"
"So, what would be the conservative plan? Quicker that possible, or as quickly as impossible? It took the Cons ten months to remove their fired leader from the job and replace him with a lighter version of the same. Who in their right mind would want them to run the vaccine delivery?"
"WHAT RIDICULOUS SMEARS O'TOOLE COMES UP WITH...exactly 1 day after Erin smeared JT in Parliament, Moderna's CEO announces Canada to receive vaccine shipment from products from their first batch.Then J&J announces an equivalent product that's ready for production, pending FDA approval.Which is to say...everything changes from day yo day. Still not a single vaccine is approved."
O'Toole was absolutely correct! The front of line promise is pure nonsense.
so how come they are starting vaccination in the UK Germany and the US on Dec 11th or 12th if none have been approved
"The US has a leader who suggested people inject bleach. If someone says they have a safe vaccine, do you really think he's going to going to wait for proof? Do you really think Trump is going to wait until Biden takes over before a vaccine is approved, whether it works or not?"
Germany has no schedule on the ECDC site. Funny you would know about this before the European CDC.
"Moderna's CEO bumped Canada to the top of the list, not because of the $Billions Canada paid back in the spring to help develop the vaccine, but just to upset DuToole for another drive-by smear? By stand up opposition, you must be referring to the NDP. The CPC seems to think 'opposition' means 'whine at every opportunity'? DuToole seems to think incessant whining is somehow going to keep the party relevant. It just makes him look childish."
"Waiting for a properly developed vaccine, Practicality NOT a Con trait, SMEARS are."
Oppositions should never oppose!
"Nope, Opposition is good when legislation is bad. Whining about everything trying to look like you're still relevant just makes you look weak."
"Those that wont get it, its your choice, I will get it and thats my choice."
Testing hasn't been completed and none of the vaccines have been approved by any country in the world. You want yours tomorrow? Cons really shouldn't make their grandstanding quite as obvious. Whining does not make 'em look relevant.
"In determining who will get the vaccine first, a picture is emerging. Among the first will be those involved in food production. This week Fifth Estate ran an item on Temporary Foreign Workers, their working conditions, and the effect of COVID 19 on them. What do you want to bet that among the first to receive the vaccine in Canada will be seasonal temporary foreign workers involved in food production? To me, vaccinating seasonal workers while the rest of us wait is just a crazy enough idea that it could happen. This government has a pattern of prioritizing its own citizens last"
That's where many are dying so yes that's where to start.
"Then hospital workers, and other grocery staff."
Those at high risk.
"My thought is that a big reason the toll was so high on seasonal workers was that the protocols in place were not adhered to. Perhaps those that employ seasonal workers should be put on notice that they must ensure worker safety next year or face serious penalties. It then falls upon the employer to improve conditions and more strictly monitor. If nothing else, that should help. No one should have to die due to their employment, seasonal worker or otherwise."
Looks like many Canadians will be making the trip south to get vaccines in the US. As quickly as possible
Going to take a lot of needles. Are those ordered?
He’s already sent them to China.
I have it in my will to pass on the casket that I use back to the funeral home so that the next guy can get a good deal on one
"How does Jt define quickly? And why cant he share the plan? Approvals will take how long? Will Hadju know the answer to that..Lots of questions, few answers"
Its kind of like asking when we'll see a budget. As quickly as possible
"Thanks to the hapless Libs, we will be dying from COVID 8 months longer than Germany, Great Britain and the USA. As quickly as possible"
"As quickly as possible, Trudeau thinks that’s an actual date. As we’ve seen as quickly as possible from the Trudeau government can be a long time."
"Trudeau and the Liberals love to quote Moderna in saying that Canada is not at the back of their line. Really? We are supposed to have a firm order for 20 million doses with Moderna. Why is it they are only delivering 2 million doses by April 1? That is only 10% of the order. That sure does not seem like a front of the line to me. The US are getting 100 million. That is the real front of the line. That is what they get for investing $2.5 billion into Moderna. Pfizer on the other hand is at least offering 4 million doses in the first quarter. That is 20% of the full order.Be honest, Canada is no where near the front of the line. as quickly as possible"
Why can't we get a definite date from this government for us getting the vaccine. as quickly as possible
"Yeah, we should have taken delivery six months before the vaccine was even tested, just in case it works. Just out of curiosity, how do you put a guaranteed delivery date on something that hasn't been invented yet?"
Canada has a firm order for 20 million doses from Moderna. They are only shipping 2 million or 10% of the order by April 1. If that is the front of the line I would sure hate to be at the back of the line.
"More and more waif like everyday Stu. Reminds us who the LPC target demographics are..Dont stay in the garage too late tonight, the bus for school is coming early tomorrow"
"Is Trudeau still working out his family'spay out plan from this manufactured scam. as quickly as possible, incompetence. "
"That's really good news and here's hoping a smooth delivery, what i dont understand in the article is the inclusion of opposition criticism when Justin actually said first that we would be delayed, unnecessary noise during a serious situation."
Opposition noise is never unwanted in a democracy.
The anti-vaxxer movement sure is picking up steam here. Good. We're overdue for some natural selection.
Just wait until he stops buying votes and starts the hard work of governing
"while he's announcing $100b additional spending, there is not an additional cent for provinces to spend on delivering health care through the pandemic.so all that spending is just virtue signaling on our dime. he's not interested in doing the right thing, or spending money where it is really necessary. the guy is the worst kind of snake oil sales man. incompetence, as quickly as possible"
JT doing an excellent job.
Self proclaimed and reported efficacy beware with that there’s a motive here and it rhymes with cash.
Which vaccine will Justin be taking? Which calibre? That would cure some of our financial malaise.
The liberals are just throwing money at a problem without any experience to actually do something:
"Conservatives. Nothing good to say, ever."
So what Canadian Government has experience dealing with a worldwide Pandemic? Once this is over the Liberals will be the only ones with experience
basic budget or executing on any plan would be a good start!
"A guy with Zero credibility says some stuff... As long as he is PM our government is a joke. As quickly as possible, incompent"
"sure, but just look at that wavy hair"
no international wars thanks to wavy hair - can't wait to see the gordian knot of war Biden gets the US in.
A PM does not a government make. Governments are made by us. Yes its true.
"We need to make a better government then. People really need to think before they vote. Look at the last two elections to see how that didn't work out for us. So, you are right Gene. We collectively do make government what it is."
Started by the current admin -no doubt. Just wait.
Is the Health Canada going to rubber stamp the foreign approvals to get the vaccine out the door as quickly as possible?
No. Simply no. They will do a thorough review as is done after any drug is done with clinical trials and all information is investigated. Too much at stake for mistakes with this.
Canada is right up near the front of the line for vaccines the COVAX line for third world countries.
I'm never going to stop masking and social distancing™. Never again will I catch so much as a cold.
From the Haida Guai in B.C. to the Manitoba bison to the Nova Scotia herring choker to the Nunavut narwahl we are all Trudeau. Go Trudeau go Moderna!
plus it won't be Moderna in the End. it'll be Chinese
Trudeau also said that the WE charity is the only one capable of distributing the vaccine.
"Trudeau proving once again he's the most clueless leader in the Western world with a statement that means nothing. As quickly as possible, incompent"
"It's pretty hard to have a clue, when we don't have the facilities to make our own vaccines. We are dependent on foreign companies, and foreign governments for our supply. Those foreign countries may take the line of 'our people first,' like Canada just did with our drug supply. We are limiting drug shipments to the US to ensure we have enough for ourselves. Do you expect other countries to act differently?"
"So, if Trudeau gave dates, they'd be subject to changes imposed by others, out of our country's control. What would you say if the dates were missed? I can already hear the people howling for blood"
"While they're at it, can they build a vaccine for the common cold?"
"Oh...you mean, viruses come in varieties? Do they tend to mutate rapidly to make more strains? You mean, we may need to line up for vaccines on an ongoing basis from now on?"
There have always been many different viruses causing colds. At least 300 at last count. They can tell because they are genetically nothing alike and as such would each need their own vaccine.
"Covid is stable, though, right? Nothing will change between the time the pharmaceutical companies cash their checks and we roll up our sleeves?"
"With all of the money dumped into covid vaccines, you never know what they learned and if it can be applied to other viruses."
"The SARS-COV2 virus mutates much slower than Influenza A, which itself has at least 12 strains. They can tell by tracking genetic changes. Pretty well all the covid-19 vaccines use the genetics of the spiked coating of the virus, which is what the virus uses to latch onto our cells. If that changes, we won't likely be able to catch it any more."
"trudeau says, Sigh. Time will tell. The writer of this article is an eastern supporter of this govt. He comes across as angry. Of course he's going to put a spin on it. But no logistics information, no time lines for Canada. The boy in Ottawa and this writer keep pushing Moderna. One of the first countries to receive the vaccine? If India is next, that's 1.3 Billion people. So what's the date? It doesn't take a PM to know that he is speaking in tongues when it comes to a date."
"India has the Serum Institute that is already slated to produce it's own version of the Oxford vaccine. They are reportedly going to produce at least 1 billion doses in 2021. We will likely get some small shipments while the US does since they have limited capability to vaccinate, and many won't even want to be vaccinated."
"Likely, probably, soon, etc. etc. etc. My point exactly. CanSino was a supposed preferred alternative with Communist China who happens to be hostile to Canada. The leader happened to be away, hobb nobbing with a bunch of foreign elites to try and get some useless seat at the UN, meanwhile our grade sixers were coming home and asking what a pandemic was. Remember? Couldn't be bothered to come home when protests shut down the Canadian economy. As the pandemic was ramping up, it was Alberta that provided ventilators, PPE, to other provinces. Not the Feds. They've been just always been a bit too late since they were elected."
"Nothing new. Politicians of all stripes have never been of much use to people. At the same time, contracts were still signed... I will take that."
"I require Trudeau's definitions for ""possible"" and ""quickly"". As quicky as possible. Trudeau says"
Don't hold your breath waiting for an answer.
Canadians will get the vaccine as soon as it is approved. As quickly as possible
Memo to Health Canada: Don't approve that vaccine until I tell you
it’s like we will run 3 small deficits and balance the budget. That turned into 2050.
"Hard to get a real answer out of this vapid truth bender. as quickly as possible, incompent"
Anyone else seen the story here amongst the bits and bytes about the British Government requiring people to be inoculated with a COVID-19 vaccine before they can enter public places? You can get an app that will proof you have.Time to move to the cabin.
Anyone believes anything he says? Trudeau says
Happy to see all the angry folks taking their frustrations out on line instead of wandering the streets with all this vitriol.
"Canadians would be happier if this government actually HAD a plan... and communicated it... instead of ""platitude"" based vague messages. A viable in-house vaccine development solution... and an actual budget, instead of Grade 3 level updates such as ""fiscal guard rails"". incompetent, as quickly as possible"
The con base will vote Con every election when these sorts of things happen.
McVeigh of federal building fame ? Definitely glad the angry are not wandering the streets.
name calling and arrogance have always been the most endearing liberal traits! Thanks for illustrating !
"It's a simple question - When?. He doesn't have an answer because he doesn't know. If he doesn't know he should say that rather than leading Canadians to believe otherwise. As quickly as possible, trudeau says"
it really is just that simple. He may even get a little respect for honesty and not dodging questions - instead real honest answers.
He's not losing your vote
" In the US, they have a very good idea. Dec. 10 is when the FDA is expected to approve the Pfizer vaccine - hospitals are expecting to administer it almost immediately thereafter. Here, not so much."
Does this guy have an answer for anything? As quickly as possible. Trudeau says
"Until this virus has been corralled, and the vaccines are a proven success, it's the hermit life for me."
"as quickly as possible, This is not reassuring."
No one knows when they will come. lets wait and see because no vaccine has been approved yet
We are waiting on China - Our Vaccine will Come from China - We love China _ we Pretty Much are China with JT in Place
"Typical Trudeau non-answer, as quickly as possible"
"what's the rush? Take your Time, Wait until China has mastered the Vaccine - then we can millions and millions of doses from them to help their economy ...Why?....Because they are Awesome and deserve it"
No vaccine has been approved yet.
"Right now, there is no vaccine."
"Time after time, Trudeau and Hajdu have shown us that Liberals and friends come first. Canadian Taxpayers come last."
"I use to love this country but now I can only love some in this country, as I watch all these events unfold . I might be forced to turn my back and not because I’m selfish but because I’m turning numb! It’s Trudeau! Incompetence. Trudeau says"
"Justin has no crebility nor does Hajdu, we will receive a small shipment for them to save face next year. If the first shipment in January is less than three million doses you know how badly they have done. As quickly as possible, incompetent"
Those who voted for this unmitigated disaster and his socialism are considerably richer at tax payers expense and “high” too. Incompetent
Seems like they are doing a good job with the vaccines. If they arrived in the first half of 2021 that would exceed reasonable expectations.
"Shouldn't your expectations be that we get the vaccine at the same pace as other countries, with reasonable allowances for the countries that manufacture to have some precedence? Setting timelines without comparison seems kind of arbitrary."
"I haven’t seen anything to make me think we won’t be on the same pace as other countries. Will we get the vaccine at the same time as the UK, Germany and the US - countries who have developed the vaccine? Not likely. But I’m not seeing any evidence that we are far behind. Health Canada is doing their due diligence and reviewing the science. Not one vaccine has been approved by any jurisdiction in the world yet. No one is trying to pull the wool over your eyes. It’s just a matter of not knowing until the scientists have said we are ready to go"
"I don't disagree and I'm happy to wait until we see how we do.. but if we fall behind our peers other than as you describe, it is fair to judge those responsible. for ordering as they certainly would take credit for being ahead.. if that's the case."
"So the only ""evidence"" that we will not get it at the same time as other similar countries is pure speculation. This isn't a race against other countries. The world needs to get a vaccine."
"This isn't a race against other countries, and evidence is lacking as to delivery. But there is no doubt that countries that acted quickly and responsibly will get the vaccine before those who didn't, or couldn't afford it."
"Sure the world needs a vaccine.. and Canada needs competent government. Lets see the world get a vaccine, and lets see if we have competent government."
"I wonder if Trudeau and his children would care to be the first recipients of this vaccine, and the bottle is randomly chosen out of a lot."
Waiting for Health Canada approval is like your tenant telling you the checks in the mail.
"Justin couldn't run a lemonade stand. He is a teleprompted, spokesmodel actor. His credentials include a background in: drama,  teaching delivering messages to children. As quickly as possible, incompetent"
What a disaster this man is but at least those who promoted him are richer at taxpayer expense. as quickly as possible. incompetent
"Novovax vaccine is most traditional, and perhaps safest when it comes to long term side effects. I would like to be able to have it. Medicago VLP seems to be safe as well, as it injects artificially made virus. Novel vaccines like mRNA, or DNA are unpredictable, developed based on limited usage of human DNA."
Medicago? I wouldn't put anything in my body coming out of Montreal. Their vaccine will be about as trustworthy as an SNC Lavalin contract.
Ok...you are entitled to have opinion. Medicago just delivers plants..it cooperates with GSK in Britain
"There's no evidence mRNA vaccines are unpredictable (or predictable) simply because these vaccines are the first mRNA vaccines ever developed. In fact, it's the lack of evidence that makes them somewhat unpredictable."
I checked the calendar and could not find as quickly as possible or ASAP on any of the months. You think that when you spend billions of Canadian dollars on a product you might have a clue within a few weeks of when you may receive delivery or you are a fool.
Of course! It's so easy to get a fixed date for a vaccine developed on a timeline faster than any vaccine in history that hasn't even been approved yet!
Trudeau says... nothing but lies.
"If we have to wait until Sept.2023 to get our vaccine so be it, it doesn't surprise me."
Health care workers likely Jan. Or Feb. Roll outs thereafter through various layers of priorities.
"Yes - those layers are like this: Trudeau, his cabinet, his family, his buddies, his protejes, then the rest of the population."
Common sense no?
common sense tells me to not believe these folks.
He can't go wrong by what he says.It will never be released until then anyway.
"Will roll out ""As quickly as possible"" That means he doesn't know when."
The US will roll out their vaccine in a few weeks. Canada will be fortunate to get theirs by next summer. Perhaps if Trudeau and the Libs hadn't antagonized Trump at every chance we would be higher on the list.
So Trudeau has spent at least $5.4 billion on Covid research and vaccine purchases.
"He has signed 6 contracts with Big Pharma which includes Moderna, Pfizer and Astrazenica."
Plus Trudeau has given money to Quebec based Medicago who said they have the capacity to produce 100 million doses in 2021.
and yet Trudeau will not inform Canadians when a vaccine will be available to them .
Have these contracts been released to the auditor general ?
She's hoping a vaccine will be available to Canadians well before the end of March.
"End of March, she hopes. US is starting this month, was there not an article here that said we were not last in line. How is US starting this month and us not starting till about April next year the first in the line, as they trying to deceiving promote on this site."
"The PM who is solely responsible for every one of the 12,000+ deaths due to covid in canada says as quickly as possible. That's encouraging !"
"Irresponsible, Incompetent"
Is every world leader directly responsible for all the deaths in their country or is it just Canada? Holding our government to higher standards when by all accounts they did as good or better than most Asian countries aside. Personal responsibility is so lacking in this overprivileged society that it is sickening.
"Just Canada.GPHIN amounted to about 20% of the WHO's intelligence capabilities. They were respected world-wide for their ability to get to the truth when time meant everything.
Canada shutting it down had worldwide implications.
O'Toole and Davies of the NDP asked why GPHIN was shut down and Trudeau avoided the question."
"When the PM gives and answer like that, he demeans the public....he puts them out their as a group that do not have the intelligence to figure out his answer. In fact the one giving the answer of ""as quickly as possible"" is the one lacking."
"Canada has secured 20 million doses of promising Moderna vaccine found to be 94.1 per cent effective: Secured"" to me means they have it in hand. Why don't I believe XiBC "
"As quickly as possible, Now dosen't that instill confidence? Such a definitive time line you could set your watch to it. I guess for the Trudeau faithful that is what passes for a plan."
"England, Russia started today. USA, France, Germany Dec 12.India , Mexico January 2021, Canada Sept 2021"
"Ridiculous, we aren't starting in September 2021. USA as far as I can find isn't starting vaccines next week. England and Russia will be the guinea pigs for the rest of us. Bless their hearts and hope all goes well. We will have proportionately the same vaccination rate as most other countries. We currently have 4 vaccines trying to get approved at Health Canada."
"apart from being terminally stupid, the moist breather seems to be in otherwise good health... I will expect him to be pretty close to the bottom of the list for his vaccination. As quickly as possible. Trudeau says"
As quickly as possible Is it possible to be anymore vague!
Ah politics. Every western country including Canada is aiming for people to be vaccinated by September 2021. O'Toole is just playing typical conservative politics where they lie about the simple stuff for effect. O'Toole knows the timeline is the same for almost every nation but none of that matters when you need a base to believe alternative facts.
Trudeau...the king of the vague non-answer! as quickly as possible. Trudeau says
"Until Trudeau clears the way for a public inquiry into WE, you can't believe a word he says."
"I trust Trudeau because he is a ""Prime Minister""... and he's speaking unto us on our National Me-dee-uh. And, he's delivering a heart felt sales pitch for his pharmaceutical buddies. Trudeau says"
"Can't believe anything he says, but the fools still support him. ""The check is in the mail, but it's going to bounce anyways"" as quickly as possible"
"ASAP, imminent, as quickly as possible, right around the corner, on the doorstep."
Spare me the BS and grandstanding and give a date time and place. You know - The things that are real.
Anand: I have bought enough freezers to store 33.5 million doses of vaccine.
"Newsflash to Anand: Canadians need the vaccine in their arms, not in freezers."
"Ship the vaccine direct from the manufacturers to Provinces, and stay out of the way."
Trudeau says vaccines will roll out as quickly as possible after Health Canada approvals.Trudeau says...LOLOLOLOLOL. Health Canada will do what Trudeau tells them to or jobs will be lost. Don't expect anything till after. October till the rookie MPs have their pensions guaranteed
"Highest debt to GDP in the G-7...........sunny ways, Second highest unemployment in the G-7........Sunny ways, A 51% debt to GDP ratio.................Sunny Ways, No rapid testing, no vaccine roll out plan...SUNNY ways, Estimated 1.3 trillion dollar debt, no budget for 18 months....SUNNY WAYS, A drama teacher PM, journalist FM, and social worker Health Minister....SUNNY SUNNY SUNNY WAYS!Multiple scandals, more ethics violation investigations, underfunded AG, prorogued Parliament,election threats, redacted documents, filibustering, destroyed documents, opioid epidemic, shuttered businesses, destroyed energy sector, housing crisis, no support for seniors or veterans, boil water advisories on First Nations, health care system stressed to the max, no freedom of information requests or order papers being attended to."
"ASAP, imminent, as quickly as possible, right around the corner, on the doorstep."
Spare me the BS and grandstanding and give a date time and place. You know - The things that are real.
"I trust the wealthy elite, multinational corporations, and the politicians and me-dee-uh they own and control."
"Well, the media, always so much feeding the opposition parties, keep asking : what's the plan, why don't you tell us when. Well, would they have accepted the answer : at 0749 on November 25... And of course, the next set of media questions would have been, at 0751 on November 25 : how come the vaccine has not yet been administered to 43 millions Canadians...."
"Trudeau said once the regulator gives the green light to one of those vaccines, Canada will mobilize its public health infrastructure to deploy it to the provinces and territories."" And the winner is ... All these vaccine company stand to make a lot of money, or not so much money. It is for this reason I am personally concerned about the ramifications of the side effect, which will not be really known for some time - by then, a billion people could have been injected with it. As I don't trust ."
"While I will be declining my shot, I just want the panic to all be over (at least for now) so we can get on with life, and have something else to talk about."
The only problem with Trudeau saying “As quickly as possible” is that nothing seems possible for them lately and show no real promise of improving. Not saying that O’Toole and crew would be any faster due to switching contracts from liberal friends to their own ready cabal of friends.
One thing that is disconcerting is what Evan Solomon reported about Canada had an opportunity to acquire licensing to manufacture the vaccine in Canada but felt it wasn't practical.Some could have been manufactured here all be it in small numbers
"OTool is coming across as a NEGATIVE NINNY for no good reason. The MILITARY, EXPERTS in supply chain logistics is in control."
"Just once I would like to open the CBC news web page and not be greeted by a large image of that half wit Trudeau. Do the CBC staff all have his photo taped to their bedroom ceilings, or what? As quicly as possible, Trudeau says"
"The current PMO and jt have been found to be 94.1% per cent ineffective. as quickly as possible, Trudeau says"
That's great ! oops we have no plants that can produce the vaccine in Canada. Oh well we can stall the restart of the economy a bit longer than other countries. We are only a service sector economy anyways.
Every day it’s a different date. Does not impart much trust.
"We are all in this together. Unless you work for the government, your loving the full pay at home with fluffy. Trudeau says"
WHY is OTool SIMPLY wineing instead of helping Canadians. This is ridiculous
"I don't understand why some people are so skeptical about Procurement Minister Anand's competence in getting us vaccine quickly. This is the same person that is buying our fighter jets. Oh, where are those fighter jets...."
"Tough to determine who is worse, the cons complaining we are not first or the Liberals praising Trudeau for backing a chinese vaccine while neglecting all the others until forced to change."
there is no such combination as 'quick and safe'...it will take months before injected people provide proof for 'safe'.
Why would any government in the world want this to end?
"Trudeau says a lot of things 95% of it is not true. 2015 last FPTP election, small 10 billion dollar deficit, back to a balanced budget in 2019, SNC is a false story, Canada will meet its 2020 GHG emission target his set. Justin, you do not have a great record of being truthful. But hey Spring follows winter and we only pay her 300,000 a year for that little gem of wisdom. as quickly as possible, incompetent"
The pandemic will have run its course on its own before Canadians get vaccinated.
"if I know Justin, like I do - he means it! as quickly as possible should quick quick. Trudeau says"
"The Finance Minister's coming out:An ""economic update"" lol (can't figure out what else to call this electioneering document), offers Canadians not a plan for ANYTHING, but ""Guard rails"", yup, that is what she said:Guard rails, LOL, Rail to nowhere.In the meantime, elbowing each other with the King yesterday after she was finished delivering, Canadians ""guard rails"", AND they are asking for four more years to deliver a further debt of 100 billion, if they are re-elected.Is this for real?"
"and at the backstage, JT will ask Health Canada to test the vaccine as much as possible before rolling out, as quickly as possible, Trudeau says"
"and at the backstage, JT will ask Health Canada to test the vaccine as much as possible before rolling out"
"Is it all that hard to understand, you will get it when its approved, not before."
"Why isn't anyone asking questions about injury compensation because this might affect you or your family.At least 19 countries already have programs in place that compensate individuals injured by vaccines, but Canada does not. In fact, it is the only G7 country without such measures in place, and experts are now calling on the federal government to prepare in advance of the COVID-19 vaccination program."
"well before the end of March, As if that’s good news... we’re way behind. As quickly as possible"
the trumpy con echo chamber here does not represent the majority Canadian view on issues
Lock stock is wondering why the opposition is holding the government to account and is asking questions. The answer by jimmie Jim is that how a democracy works.. Left does not get that do they?
first time hadju has appeared since her masklessness and pearson? did she get a ticket or a fine?
"Just bide time with the vaccine.Unless, of course, you want it as quick as possible and willing to take risks? This being in a country with a significant number of anti-vaccine folks and vaccine programs that took 'years' to get to convince to take it for the more routine flu season.Again, just bide time with the vaccine.In the meantime - and Ontario and my province of Alberta in particular, wear those masks and practice social distancing. And next time, 'really' think hard about who or rather 'what' you elect to lead your provinces. "
As Trudeau says..we are doing everything we can to free the 2 Michaels ...now says we are doing everyting we can to get these vacines out asap... Hmmm. As quickly as possible.
"Florida becomes the third state to reach 1 million coronavirus cases, And Trudeau still for Canadian Snow Birds from Ont and Quebec to go back and forth at will "
"Conservatives and their I never liked Trump anyway' theory that has risen recently, reminds me of the diminished number of people who voted for 'Scheer' after he was tossed as leader."
A new poll suggests most Canadians aren’t currently worried that people in other countries might get a COVID-19 vaccine first.
One of the countries the CPC was concerned would get vaccines before us has been running a phase 3 trial of that CanSino vaccine O'Toole is so against.
"Ease up on Justin, hard things are hard."
"Is anybody still listening, Trudeau says "
"found to be 94.1% effective, define ""found to be"""
"Ah this is good, we have gone from ""hopefully by Sept"" to "" as quickly as possible"" which will be followed by "" I have no idea"" to "" ""my friends in the 3rd world who vote for UN seats needed it more than we did"". Trudeau says"
"only 20 million? guess he has a math problem, cant wait for the left to turn on each other and fight to get it, enjoy your rushed vaccine side effects"
Canadians with the means will end up buying the Vaccine in the USA.Thank you Capitalism!
"Out of the cottage, read prepared statement by handlers, increase debt, back to the cottage."
"Don't want to wait for a vaccine, hop on a plane and go get the Russian one."
"As soon as his buddies position themselves to cash in on the market reaction, as quickly as possible, Trudeau says"
What a clown
"as quickly as possible, slow news day"
"For all those going on and on about an arrival date for the vaccine in Canada, I have the answer. The first batch will arrive on Dec17 at 2:42 EST give or take 10 minutes depending on the line up at the border."
"over paid for the vaccine then a donation to the trudeau foundation is probably why it got done, as quickly as possible, Trudeau says"
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with reporters outside Rideau Cottage on Tuesday but never answered 1 question by reporters
"He is so full of himself , most ignorant PM ever"
"If you still believe a word Trudeau says than I have bad news. He's smarter than you, as quickly as possible"
"Good thing that Hajdu says we are at the ""front of the line"". What a big joke."
They will have the biggest most robust portfolio that the world has ever seen. Nobody has ever hand anything bigger. Justin and Trump are two peas in the same pod. The only difference is that Justin shows up a day late and dollar short.
"Based on all his other claims do you really take JT seriously? If so then you are a true Liberal. Trudeau says, as quickly as possible"
"This government is making the distribution of this vaccine unnecessarily complicated and potentially wasteful. Clearly they are planning on shipping all vaccine from the factory to Ottawa for storage and distribution. This is wrong. Lets take the Pfizer vaccine for example. Pfizer ships it in small insulated boxes packed with dry ice. No special freezers necessary. Each box contains 1000 doses of vaccine. It appears they may supply 4 million doses by April 1 2021. All they need is a distribution plan that has the shipping addresses in each provinces. My math suggest these are the number of vaccine boxes they need to ship direct to each province. It is not really a big number. FedEX, DHL, and UPS can easily handle it. And, they are not likely to be made available at the same time, so the individual shipment numbers are likely to be even smaller. No boxes need to go to Ottawa. Ship direct. "
Trudeau says vaccines will roll out as quickly as possible. Lord help us!
"I don't remember Justin Trudeau has ever given an answer to any question. Trudeau says, as quickly as possible"
"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is set to meet on Dec. 10 to review the Pfizer product. Health Canada's chief medical adviser, Supriya Sharma, has said regulators here are expected to make decisions on timelines similar to those followed by the U.S.""- LOL Health Canada is always months behind the US and Europe in approving anything"
Maybe hiding from the WE Charity scandal for 5 weeks wasn't a great idea. Of course we are talking about Justin. Creating scandal is about his only skill
"Lock downs in effect in ON, PQ and MB.... Numbers continue to go up. Lock Downs DO NOT WORK"
"So the vaccine will be approved and safe to use in the U.S and in the UK.If the vaccine is safe to use on Americans and Brits the vaccine is safe to use on Canadians. There is no need for Health Canada to do their own safety trials.Last I looked Canadians share the same genetic makeup as everyone else on the planet, unless they know something we don't."
"Why do the liberals on here not want this government held accountable for the decisions they made? If they had reasonable answers why not tell us or is it because they have no answers? Trudeau says, as quickly as possible"
"Just look at the WHO communique for third world Countries, We don’t yet know exactly when a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine will be ready for distribution, but we estimate that it could be in early to mid-2021"
Did trudeau mix up the vaccine speech with his weed speech? It's about the only rolling he knows.
Is he phoning Greta and asking if she has any spare vaccine?
Why don't they just say health canada is waiting for FDA approval. sad but it is what it is
This fall update is going to be a confidence vote. The Cons greatest fear might be realized. An election where they would lose seats.
"I am ok with people not wanting to take the vaccine, but I am also ok with government facilities and private businesses to refuse entry and in person services to people who refuse the vaccine when it is available to everyone. I am all about personal choice."
"If you watched question period today you will know the Trudeau Liberals have no idea when a Covid19 vaccine will be available for Canadians. Trudeau says, as quickly as possible"
"JT call an election, I would like to vote against you as quickly as possible. You have failed as PM. Great legacy in the making"
"The Finance Minister/Minister of Everything, in concert with the King, is rolling the economic dice on low interest rates. Yup, that is the only plan they got."
"Quick, change the narrative says the other liberal talking head"
"as quickly as possible When there is no plan, vague statements will do. The bar is so low with Trudeau it doesn't really matter anymore."
"Hey Health Canada... It's Justin. Can you do me a solid? Could you please delay approving any of the Covid vaccines until I give you a sign? It appears that I'm nowhere near the front of the vaccine procurement lines and I just don't have a distribution plan yet, so, as my arch-nemesis used to say, I'm just not ready... So, stall for me bro? Thanks man. as quickly as possible, Trudeau says"
Now Trudeau is tying himself into knots trying to figure who will get vaccinated first...Well...who will vote for me...that is the order of the distribution...PO make it so...
"We spent millions on NRC research that was given to CanSino for no returns, while our Canadian hostages sat in a 3x3 cell. Who does this Trudeau government work for?"
"Ordering 20 million doses prior to their approval? Just like WE, announce first then flounder second."
"Man, a month ago, most of these daily whiners were on about the lockdowns, the whole thing being overblown, the ineffectiveness of masks, the high cost of vaccines, and the fear of taking one some even claim they're being made to create 'zombies' out of all of us. Today, it's all about how soon we can get them and how fast we can take them. What a world it is!"
"The next excuse, inclement weather, snowstorm delays. Trudeau says, as quickly as possible"
We shall. I heard on the news this morning that Germany is constructing large facilities just for the purpose of getting people through for their vaccinations as quickly as possible. I have my doubts we'll see that kind of efficiency here.
if JT and the Liberals would've secured the vaccine any sooner the Cons would whinge that it was too soon and untested. That's why the Cons are basically unelectable
"Complete mix messaging happening. “We are not at the front of the list but we are not at the back” this is the manufacture, is it true?"
The African countries that helped Trudeau with his failed UN seat also want to know when they are getting their vaccines. The Liberals didn't order 382 million shots for nothing.
"Can we have a date please, a week or a month might do also."
"Too little too late, sorry premiers. we would have need it like last month."
How many of Canada's vaccines will end up on Bell Island?
"Hajdu says vaccine distribution a 'very delicate dance'. Sounds like they're already warming us up for ""We won't be able to get it""."
O'Toole deserves no respect whatsoever.
"In the meantime, slap on a mask and wash your hands."
"Looking forward to the coverage of President-elect Biden and Vice Harris receiving the virus vaccine, the second week of December should play well on Canadian media as we wait and wait. Trudeau says, as quickly as possible"
The vaccine will be FREE to all Canadians. A lot of things are free to all Canadians in JT's eyes.
"Every time Trudeau is asked 'When' he answers 'Robust Portfolio' and highest number of doses per capita. Only question he does not answer is 'When'. As quickly as possible, Trudeau says "
Will our politicians try this vaccine first?
"If they pass on, nothing lost."
If they don't we`ll know it`s safe.
"No budget, no plan and no vaccine anytime soon. Trudeau says, as quickly as possible"
Delaying the vaccine is about buying time to move out the billions to friends and for vote buying at the expense of the population
Get it into gear Trudeau. Actually make/have a plan and do something.
I'm thinking about a year from now before the vaccine is available to most Canadians.
As quickly as possible. Canadians need that to be an election called! Get Canadians out of this mess he has created! Trudeau says
Which vaccine do you want? Will Moderna have less side effects than Pfizer. They both need a second shot? One has to be stored at -80 F. Other companies are close to a single shot vaccine. Which one of these will need an annual booster? Shouldn't we have some answers before a vaccine is rolled out?
"According to Question period these liberals can""t even get their dates right when it comes to vaccines, as quickly as possible, Trudeau says"
"as quickly as possible. explain why Procurement Minister Anand is buying freezers and planning on shipping the vaccine from Pfizer to Ottawa for storage and distribution instead of directly shipping the vaccine to the provincial vaccination sites. Shipping vaccine to Ottawa for distribution will add many days if not weeks to the distribution process. Worldwide it is estimated 50% of all vaccines are wasted due to shipping and storage issues. We cannot afford to do this with COVID vaccines. These require special handling, and doubling the distribution and handling will only increase the risk of wastage. All this when 100 Canadians are dying per day due to this pandemic"
Prorogued parliament in the middle of a pandemic didn’t help.
Maybe the federal opposition just isn't whining 'enough' in social media forums?Maybe that's why they are being kept out of governance??
"My Alberta tax dollars at work, the Kenney warroom out spouting O'Toole baseless & senseless rhetoric"
He talks and says nothing as usual! Need an election fast so Canadians can get out of his debt! Trudeau says as quickly as possible
He needs time to dish out billions on vote buying and greasing the wheels. Trudeau says as quickly as possible
"All the people on here complaining about this aren't going to get the vaccine anyway, so just leave. Your points are moot and invalid."
Getting tired of Otooles usual rhetoric. A vaccine is ready when it's ready. You can't give a timeline on research.
"What rubbish.As quickly as possible, Now that is a reassuring definitive statement.How can anyone continue to defend this train wreck"
As quickly as possible and asap is what you tell people when you don't know or you want to brush them off. A better answer might be I don't have a clear date but will keep you updated as information becomes available
I say go for it - any problem with the vaccine can't be any worse than suffocating to death
so 6 months to year after the rest of the world approves it? Of course there is no plan. This is the Liberal Government. Planning takes too much time and expertise and those are things they do not have.
Vaccinations are a provincial health care issue : why is COVID any different from the flu vaccine?
The Feds dont order nor distribute the flu vaccine BUT COVID is different.
All governments and parties should be working together to help control this pandemic!
"That deal was abandoned after the regime in Beijing blocked shipments of vaccine samples meant to be used in clinical trials in Canada,"""
I guess Trudeau's admiration counts for nothing when it comes to China. That doesn't bode well for Spavor and Kovrig.
About the straightest read you`re gonna get on Canadian politics right now is Evan Solomon on CTV. I don`t expect him to be there for much longer.
"Donald Trudeau telling another bigly tale to Canadians. Covfefe rules. Trudeau says, as quickly as possible"
"Trudeau deserves two more majority terms as PM, a Nobel Peace Prize, and two terms as UN Secretary General. He is the best leader in world history"
With recent polls showing that a sizeable number of Canadians will refuse a vaccine altogether
That's because a sizeable number of Canadians don't trust Trudeau and with just cause. Trudeau says as quickly as possible
"Canadian officials have been largely quiet about how the deployment will be conducted here, beyond offering assurances that the provinces and territories will be ready to go. This is the biggest problem. Why people are questioning anything. What are these plans except to claim that the vaccine will go out where is needed."
"There are certain phrases in manufacturing that make us cringe. ""I'll do it as quickly as possible."" is one of those. It is better to replace that with a schedule. Something like ""from the day vaccines are available we will have 90% of critical recipients serviced in 5 days."" Something measurable. But on the other hand. Do your best. That's fine."
this government is unqualified to run a lemonade stand let alone a country. As quickly as possible Trudeau says
"Every Fall we deliver 30+ million doses of Flu vaccine to all the people of Canada. Successfully. The supply chain and the distribution services are all there, many of them still handing out the last of the flu vaccines. So why would this be much different? Mountains out of mole hills? Oh, we're the opposition so we'd better complain about something. Can an opposition party never say, "" Good job!"" or ""How can we help?"". This is how extreme partisanship and populism begin."
"So when do liberals start holding this government terrible record on every single thing they touch against them? Vote NDP or Rhino, how could you ethically stand by this trash? You sure don’t admit in public you back his constant never ending failures. Stop propping the loser up. Trudeau says as quickly as possible"
Walking expectations back every day now
What if I don't agree with his choice of vaccine?
approvals sometime soon. They're too slow to catch a cold
Trudeau has saved millions of lives and will win a massive majority next election.
still have no date. only pass the ball to health Canada Trudeau says
Some will wait for the vaccine for the virus from Norton or McAfee
Delicate dance? Cut through the crap!
"AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine could be a lost cause if it turns out that it cannot protect the elderly against the disease, Malcolm Kendrick, an NHS GP told news. He warned that on the other hand, US vaccines could be dangerous."
"Both American vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA) to combat the virus. That is an advanced genetic therapy that uses the virus’ own genetic material against it. Kendrick, however, warns that the technology is really new and untested, meaning no one really knows how it could affect human health, since it literally hijacks the cellular reproduction mechanism"
Soon your employer will require you to get the vaccine in order to return to work. (Already happening in Europe)
Soon you will require the vaccine in order to fly ( already happening in Australia)
.....All the while our government will continue the propaganda that the vaccine will be voluntary

Doesn't O'Toole want any vaccine option 'investigated' first by a Parliamentary committee
Like Trudeau we seem to be living in never never land....We think that we can go through a pandemic without changing our lives. The financial impact will be very long lasting. Small businesses are shutting down where many are employed

"If the LPC lemmings had their way there would be no questions asked of the government, no expectations and the stuff, whatever it is, is will just happen when the drama. teacher decides. Trudeau says as quickly as possible"
as quickly as possible Meaning - trudeau has no clue. No surprise.
"so now that he knows canada will be far down the list as far as receiving the vaccine, this government is going to play on the fears of those who think the vaccine will do more harm than good, they are going to claim that the reason canada took so long to get a vaccine, is because they wanted to make sure it was safe. what a disgusting human being"
He really has no idea of what he is doing. Trudeau says as quickly as possible
"Opposition will cry too slow, and then if any issues with the vaccine and its effect on Canadians, they will cry too fast, The role of opposition, Silly, really"
I remember it was only a few short months ago when it was reported that a covid vaccine was possibly “years away” or even unattainable
The important factor in all of this is that the more people who get vaccinated the more effective it will be . The more effective the vaccine is the faster we return to a new normal
Pfizer's 1st mass shipment of the vax landed in Chicago last week
I'm fine with waiting until it is deemed safe by Health Canada. The last thing I want to is for my family to be injected with a vaccine that is not proven to be safe
as quickly as possible is moot
"So no timeline, no answers... all we know is other countries get theirs first... because Justin was too busy deflecting from scandals, spending and proroguing... to actually engage with other parliamentarians on actual COVID related solutions... so much Liberal arrogance, so little talent. Trudeau says as quickly as possible"
Our PM is only good at promising things that will come due in 2050. Trudeau says as quickly as possible
"the endless vaccine conversation has made me scream ""ENOUGH"" and completely tune it out to save my sanity. I realize more and more every day that the only person who can protect me IS me. A totally unproven and extremely rushed vaccine with unknown side effects being presented to people like it's a saviour is way more about government appearances of doing ""something"" than actually ""doing something""! IMO of course!"
"In the UK they plan on some sort of covid vaccination credential system to prove your inoculation. No shot, no entry to any restaurant, gym, work etc etc etc. Not a very bright future to look forward to."
Yes the vaccines were rushed into production....but here we are. We take the vaccine and roll the dice and life returns to somewhat normal or we play hide and seek with a deadly virus for many years to come
"You know for all the bad press and clear ill will towards Trump, the USA is getting the vaccines and we will be forced to wait, mostly due to our very bureaucratic socialist government in Ottawa."
"If the vast majority of the country is not vaccinated until September, and in other countries, such as the United States, people are vaccinated in the first quarter of the year, then Mr. Trudeau will be seeking new employment in my opinion. Incompetent, failure"
"A vaccine for a virus that cannot be detected from a ""test"" not meant to test viruses, is not a vaccine worth taking. That and the fact that Gates, Schwab et al are openly telling the world of their nefarious plans."
The least important ones to get the shots are JT and his entourage
"No matter what happens Trudeau will come out of this If the vaccine turns out to be a dud he""s good If on the other hand there are no ill effects from it He'll blame health Canada for the delay"
why is it that ethnic background is now a factor for who gets vaccinated first
"Has Trudeau ever been clear on anything? Even when he repeatedly says "" let me be perfectly clear with Canadians"" followed by a word salad that is anything but clear. You gotta give him marks for fooling his followers...time and time again"
"Like with almost everything Trudeau says and his government says, we are still left with no real idea of what as quickly as possible means. Yes it's a true statement, the vaccination program will roll out as quickly as possible for a program with little or no planning. It doesn't matter if the government has things all planned out behind closed doors, if they don't share those plans with those who have to execute those plans, then quickly as is possible will be slower than it needs to be."
All is Trudeau has to do is pick up the telephone and make the call or is he gun shy now
"You know for all the bad press and clear ill will towards Trump, the USA is getting the vaccines and we will be forced to wait, mostly due to our very bureaucratic socialist government in Ottawa"
"Roll Trudeau out,the virus in Canada."
As quickly as possible this could be 2022
This just in. Canada's deputy finance minister had resigned. Even they can see the financial horror JT and Freeland are unleashing on us!
